Evolving UK monetary policy in an evolving world − speech by Huw Pill
In this speech, Huw addresses three interrelated issues.
First, he reviews the immediate economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy. He concludes that, while further cuts in Bank Rate over the coming year would follow from an evolution of the economic and inflation outlook broadly in line with what the MPC anticipates, it will continue to be important to guard against the risk of cutting rates either too far or too fast. On this basis, a more cautious pace of withdrawing monetary policy restriction than seen over the past year may be appropriate from here forward in order to ensure continuation of the disinflation process back towards the 2% target.
Second, Huw reviews how the framework for monetary policy at the Bank of England is evolving in light of the recent Bernanke review.
And third, he outlines some more concrete ideas about how that framework will evolve in the future.

Explaining the consumption gap - speech by Catherine L Mann
Speech
Introduction
The risks to the outlook for the UK economy are two-fold. Inflation remains persistently persistent and the outlook for growth remains modest. As a monetary policymaker I face a trade-off: leaning against upside inflation with tight(er) policy versus supporting economic growth with loose(r) policy. In my most recent speech , I laid out the research that supports my view that the upside inflation scenario from the May 2025 Monetary Policy Report is playing out; and I argued that policy needed to remain restrictive for longer both to squeeze out inflation persistence, but also to rein in expectations drift observed in the data. footnote  However, I also presented evidence of downside risks to GDP outcomes that warranted further examination to evaluate the probability that those risks would materialize.
So today, I would like to focus on the weakness in demand, zeroing in on consumption. First, because consumption accounts for nearly two thirds of total GDP. footnote  Secondly, and importantly, judgements on the trajectories for consumption and the saving ratio have played a central role in the overall forecast on which I make monetary policy decisions. Risks to these judgements warrant research attention. footnote  In the following remarks, I will outline some of this research using aggregate, and importantly, disaggregated data that inform my outlook for consumption.
Where we start is sobering: aggregate real household consumption in the UK is far from its pre-Covid trend, and the household saving ratio has risen to nearly 12% in recent quarters. footnote  By evaluating macro- and microdata and research I can evaluate the underpinnings of this consumption weakness, and what this means for the outlook for consumption growth over the monetary policy horizon and for the monetary policy stance.
Aggregate economic activity
In my last speech ( Mann, 2025b ), I introduced a new model produced by Bank staff using a quantile MIDAS regression approach that incorporates different types of activity data to quantify the likelihood of different GDP outcomes, to understand the distribution of risks around GDP growth ( Mantoan and Verlander, 2025 ). Before turning to consumption, I show an update of the model-based forecast of the entire distribution of future GDP outcomes in Chart 1 , which allows me to assess and quantify the downside risks to growth that concern me. I show the updated GDP nowcast distribution for September in aqua. Compared to earlier nowcasts this year, the distribution of possible GDP outcomes is wider and flatter – indicating a significant degree of uncertainty about future GDP growth.

Notes: Methodology using non-parametric distributions based on Mitchell et al. (2024) . One-quarter-ahead probability distributions for quarter-on-quarter GDP growth fitted from Quantile-MIDAS outputs to a non-parametric distribution. Monthly labels refer to the nowcast of the respective quarter of the year that the month falls in. For example, December 2024 represents quarter-on-quarter GDP growth for Q4 2024 based on data until December 2024.
A significant mass of the distribution is in the left tail, and in negative growth territory. This indicates that downside risks to demand growth have increased and could materialize to varying degrees. Could this be driven by downside risks to consumption?
To understand if consumption is a source of GDP weakness, we need to understand what drives it. I will therefore only focus on the consumption component of GDP. How much households can spend, save, and borrow is influenced by current economic conditions (including fiscal and monetary policy), their own financial situation (income, wealth, including through housing, and borrowing), and their expectations of the future. These expectations can include their view of the macroeconomy, inflation, interest rates, and job prospects.
How has consumption fared so far? As the left panel of Chart 2 shows, there was a clear upward trend in nominal and real consumption between 2011 and 2019. Since the pandemic and the energy shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, even though nominal spending has returned to its historical trend, real consumption has flatlined. What explains this consumption gap – the persistent deviation of real consumption volumes from trend growth?
Chart 2: Household nominal and real (disposable) income and consumption relative to trend
Levels, 2019 Q4 = 100
Source: ONS and Bank calculations.
Notes: Nominal household consumption is total household domestic expenditure excluding imputed rentals and financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM). Real consumption is the nominal consumption measure deflated by the ONS cash basis household expenditure implied deflator. Nominal household income includes labor income, property income, interest receipts, and government transfers. Disposable income corresponds to nominal income minus taxes (including National Insurance contributions), interest payments on loans, and other transfers, and also corresponds to the ONS cash basis household disposable income measure. Real disposable income is disposable income deflated by the ONS cash basis household expenditure implied deflator. Dotted lines show a log-linear trend estimated over a 2011-2019 sample period. Latest data: Q2 2025.
A key question about the gap is that real incomes (shown in the gold line on the right panel of Chart 2 ) – the most fundamental driver of consumption – have recently grown at rates similar to, or even slightly above the pre-Covid average again, albeit having shifted to a below-trend growth path. However, the wedge between the rise in nominal incomes (in pink) and real incomes (in gold) illustrates how much worse-off households are in real terms following the recent inflationary episode. The picture becomes even starker when looking at real disposable incomes (in purple), which have shifted even further below trend than real incomes. Partly responsible for this are frozen tax brackets, which (particularly in light of higher inflation) have dragged on households’ real disposable incomes, and consequently, their ability to spend, but higher interest payable has contributed to the downward shift in real incomes, too. footnote  In fact, around 65% of the difference between real incomes and real disposable incomes is accounted for by taxes and 13% by employee national insurance contributions in Q2 2025. footnote
The UK’s consumption gap is an outlier relative to its closest international peers. Chart 3 shows that real consumption in the US and the euro area has returned to its trend growth rate, albeit having recovered from a smaller Covid drop, and to a slightly shallower trend than previously observed in the UK.

Notes: The measures of UK household consumption (nominal and real) displayed in the left panel of Chart 3 differ from the measures used in Chart 2. In this chart, nominal household consumption includes individual consumption expenditure of households and non-profit institutions serving households, and real consumption is obtained by deflating nominal consumption with the consumption deflator. The measures used here allow us to make an international comparison for illustrative purposes, but with similar trends. Dotted lines show a log-linear trend estimated over a 2011-2019 sample period. Latest data: Q2 2025.
Like other components of GDP and national accounts data, consumption data is revised annually in the ONS’s Blue Book revision, with the latest revision published only last month. The left panel of Chart 4 shows the consumption trajectory before the Blue Book 2025 revisions in aqua – this is the information that fed into my August monetary policy decision. The revisions (in orange) not only change our picture on where consumption growth is now – they also revise our understanding of the past. Revising national accounts data, of course, is necessary and important, as more complete data are incorporated. However, this creates uncertainty from the monetary policymaker’s point of view on both past consumption and, consequently, our view of the future consumption path.

Notes: The measures of UK household consumption displayed in Chart 4 differ from the measures used in Chart 2. In the left panel of Chart 4, real consumption is obtained by deflating nominal consumption (which includes individual consumption expenditure of households and non-profit institutions serving households) with the consumption deflator. This is to show the impact of data revisions and the consumption data used in the MPC’s forecast. In the right panel of Chart 4, investment includes business investment and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), and statistical discrepancy and other includes stocks. Latest data: Q2 2025.
The right panel of Chart 4 confirms that consumption is the main drag on otherwise positive GDP revisions.
Consumption and the saving ratio are two sides of the same coin – revisions to consumption also imply a revised understanding of households’ saving behavior in the economy. The household saving ratio is a particular area where I feel we have been making key judgement calls as part of the monetary policy decision-making process. Can we assess the magnitude and implications of those calls?
Evaluating forecast errors of the saving ratio is challenging for various reasons. Annual Blue Book revisions mean we cannot make time-consistent evaluations of our forecasting ability beyond one year ahead. Once a new Blue Book comes out, we cannot evaluate the performance of a forecast from one year before on this new, revised information because it was not available to the forecaster at the time of the forecast.
Chart 5 therefore outlines our forecasts of the household saving ratio, split by Blue Book iterations, so as to only compare forecasts that were based on the same understanding of past outturns. On the left, I show the four forecasts following the Blue Book 2023 revisions. Comparing the pink line to the evolution of the forecasts shows that we tended to underestimate the saving ratio. On the right-hand side, I show the four forecasts following the Blue Book 2024 revisions, which show a better track record.

Notes: Solid lines show households’ saving ratio outturns and Blue Book revisions from 2023, 2024, and 2025. Dashed lines show saving ratios from the MPC’s respective forecasts.
This is not a true forecast evaluation. While I do control for Blue Book revisions, I omit news to the profile from changes in the conditioning assumptions of the forecast, and thus these charts are an incomplete exploration of true forecast errors. But, this is not my intention. The point is: should households engage in more precautionary saving behavior than projected, there would be a downside risk to consumption. This judgement call – this risk – is one that I am paying particular attention to and looking for evidence to understand. In other words, we have persistently projected the saving ratio to fall, but we are yet to see this play out in a sustained way in the data outturns. That is why it is such a large judgement call for me.
To summarize this section: at the aggregate level, downside risks to near-term GDP growth have risen, but are more dispersed. Real consumption is weak, and recent Blue Book revisions have revised down consumption growth over the past, potentially changing our view on the outlook for future consumption as well. Volatility in the paths for the saving ratio creates uncertainty about the risks to consumption. This highlights the importance of looking at more disaggregated data to better understand the source of consumption underperformance relative to its historical trend. For the purpose of this speech, I will focus on exploring how (1) the recent inflationary episode, (2) the impact of higher interest rates, and (3) uncertainty and volatility in prices have affected household consumption and may explain consumption weakness, and hence this gap.
The recent inflation episode and the price level shift
How has the recent inflation episode affected household perceptions and experience of inflation? Between the global financial crisis and the pandemic, prices rose by just under our 2% target per year, on average. So, price level shifts and inflation were both modest. Chart 6 shows that if that trajectory (in purple) had continued, prices would now be around 10% higher than at the end of 2019. But following the inflation surge in 2021-22, prices are now 30% higher – a three-fold increase in the price level relative to their pre-Covid trajectory. This means that UK households have experienced 12 years of inflation in a little over 2 years. This importantly has contributed to the stark wedge between nominal and real disposable incomes that I showed in the right panel of Chart 2 .
Chart 6: Consumer Price Index, with pre- and post-energy shock trends

Notes: Dotted lines show a log-linear trend estimated over 2011-2019 (in purple) and 2023-2025 (in orange). Latest data: August 2025.
Even as inflation has returned closer to our 2% target since its peak, we should remind ourselves of the fact that the cumulative increase in the price level does not just “wash out” of the consumer psyche when inflation returns to target.
First, the price level per se will not fall – and when households talk about the “cost of living”, it is the jump in the price level that they often refer to, not necessarily the inflation rate. In the latest Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey, when asking respondents what was influencing their inflation expectations, 33% of respondents cited past price changes ‘over the longer term’, double the share of respondents in 2019. This suggests that not only do a significant share of households form their expectations of future inflation in a backward-looking way, but an increasing share of respondents forms their inflation expectations today based on how prices have evolved in comparison to an earlier period some years ago, likely relative to the pre-Covid period I show in Chart 6 .
Second, research shows that consumers who have experienced difficult economic times learn from these episodes – they become more pessimistic about their personal finances and continue to spend less for many more years. footnote  Some areas of research have highlighted the impact of pandemics on consumer behavior and find a higher desire to save due to precautionary motives ( Jordà et al., 2022 ). Others, using US data, suggest that people’s personal inflation experiences are important for their expectations and decision-making ( Malmendier and Nagel, 2016 ), including the decisions of monetary policymakers ( Malmendier et al., 2021 ). Research, using a panel of countries including the US and the euro area, finds that households are also more attentive to inflation in an environment where inflation is already high ( Weber et al., 2025 ).
In addition to different perceptions about the inflation rate versus the cumulative change in the price level, households’ experience of inflation can differ based on the types of goods and services they consume, which in turn can also influence their inflation expectations and consumption decisions. The consumer price index, the measure we use for our 2% inflation target, is constructed using a representative basket of goods and services that the typical household in the UK consumes. As a representative index, it does not consider heterogeneity across households.
When forming their inflation expectations, households might not consider CPI as their reference index, and instead form expectations based on their own experienced inflation rate. footnote  In Chart 7 , I plot Household Cost Indices (HCIs), which show how different groups of households – specifically across different deciles of the income distribution – have experienced changes in prices over the past years, based on what they consume. HCIs weight goods and services consumed by specific household groups to construct their experienced inflation rates, which differ based on the relative importance of specific items in these households’ consumption baskets. The indices also include owner occupiers’ housing costs and the cost of interest payments on debt, such as mortgages.
Chart 7: Household Cost Indices across income deciles
Percentage point contributions from (non-)discretionary items to household costs
Source: ONS and Bank calculations.
Notes: Chart shows Household Cost Indices since January 2022 for the 2 nd , 5 th , and 9 th disposable income decile. Non-discretionary items include food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing, water, electricity, gas and fuels (COICOP codes 01 and 04), and discretionary items include all remaining COICOP categories of expenditure at division level.
The first point I would like to make is that household costs (the aqua line) did not rise equally across income deciles – they rose more at the lower end of the income distribution over 2022-23 (left panel of Chart 7 ). This largely reflects the higher share of spending on essentials (orange bars) relative to discretionary items (purple bars) compared to higher-income households. It also implies that lower-income households had less scope to cut spending compared to their higher-income counterparts, whose cost increases were relatively more impacted by discretionary items. footnote
We can break down the costs of essential items into further subcategories to explore specific drivers of consumers’ personal inflation rates. Chart 8 plots the same HCIs, splitting the essential (non-discretionary) category into individual components. Food and non-alcoholic beverages (in orange) and energy prices (in gold) contributed to a majority of the increase in low- and middle-income households’ cost of living throughout 2022 and 2023. footnote  The impact of these two categories on households’ experienced inflation rates is particularly relevant due to their salience in households’ expectation formation. Anesti et al. (2025) show that households’ inflation perceptions and expectations are particularly sensitive (and persistent) to their experienced food price-driven inflation, indicating that these items have a lot of weight in households’ expectations and decisions.
Finally, housing costs were also an important contributor to households’ cost of living, although to different extents. As Chart 8 shows, lower-income households were particularly affected by higher rents (in blue), especially throughout 2024, while households at the upper end of the income distribution were more affected by mortgage interest payments (in pink). This reflects that low-income households are predominantly renters, while a majority of high-income households either have a mortgage or own their property outright. That affects the strength of the cash-flow channel of monetary policy transmission through mortgage rates, which I discuss in more detail in my section on the impact of monetary policy on consumption.

Notes: Chart shows Household Cost Indices since January 2022 for the 2 nd , 5 th , and 9 th disposable income decile. Discretionary items include all COICOP categories of expenditure except codes 01 and 04.
To summarize this section: the large cumulative shift in the price level has affected households’ real incomes and likely continues to affect consumer behavior even as the inflation rate has moderated. Further, consumers do not just pay attention to CPI inflation, but also to their experienced inflation rates, which differ in overall level and composition across income deciles. For the next section, I will therefore use a combination of survey evidence and estimated consumption elasticities to hypothesize on potential scarring effects on consumers from this inflationary episode.
Has the series of adverse shocks scarred consumers?
To answer the question on whether the inflation shock since 2021 is a possible explanation for the UK consumption gap, we can use empirical work to link the impacts of past inflationary supply shocks to consumption volumes. Negative supply shocks, such as a surge in energy prices, can generate scarring effects that may reinforce and prolong the inflationary impact of supply disruptions (Fornaro and Wolf, 2023) . The resulting drop in wealth induced by these negative supply shocks (mainly through the fall in firm investment that reduces the economy’s future productive capacity) depresses consumers’ demand, and hysteresis may amplify and prolong the rise in inflation triggered by these shocks.
Chart 9 shows the impulse response functions of the consumer price index on the left, and the associated real consumption responses on the right-hand side, split by goods and services, to a supply-side shock normalized to increase the consumer price index by 1 percent at peak. Real goods consumption falls by more than 1.5% following the shock, whereas real services consumption falls only by around a third of that, and not always statistically significantly so. The effect on consumption remains negative throughout our forecast horizon. So, consumer responses in terms of real consumption volumes could be expected more in goods than in services. Goods consumption reflects around 50% of total consumption. footnote

The supply shock is proxied using a high frequency identified instrument by Känzig (2021) .
In addition to looking at the aggregate consumption response to an inflationary shock, we can turn to evidence from household surveys to see how the different inflation experiences I presented in Charts 7 and 8 earlier have influenced people’s consumption behavior. The left panel of Chart 10 shows a snapshot of responses to a question about changes in spending behavior across income quintiles in response to the increased cost of living, taken at the peak of the cost-of-living crisis in Q3 2022, from the Bank of England/NMG Survey of Household Finances. It shows that different experiences of the cost of certain items and their relevance in households’ consumption baskets have shaped households’ consumption behavior during the inflationary period.

Notes: The left chart shows the share of respondents in the Bank of England/NMG Survey of Household Finances responding to how their total spending has changed due to the increase in the cost of living over the past six months at the time of the survey. Asked to respondents who said that the cost of everything they would normally buy has increased compared to six months ago. Survey conducted between 30 August and 17 September 2022. The right chart shows the share of respondents in the Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey responding to which actions (if any) they are taking, or planning to take, in light of their expectations of price changes over the next twelve months. Surveys conducted between February 2018 and August 2025.
Lower-income households sought to limit the rise in their costs by reducing the quantity of goods and services they bought or by substituting towards cheaper products to cut spending in real terms (orange bars). This is consistent with findings in the literature, which show that inflation inequality during the cost of living crisis was driven by systematically higher price growth for lower-quality goods, which are disproportionately consumed by lower-income households ( Chen et al., 2025 ). On average, higher-income households have continued to consume similar goods and services as before and have therefore spent more overall (shown in the purple bars), indicating that they smoothed through the cost-of-living shock ( Herler and Tasker, 2022 ).
These results reflect consumer behavior at the height of the cost-of-living crisis. Have these changes in consumption behavior persisted? Data from the Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey suggests yes. The data, shown in the right-hand panel of Chart 10 , shows the self-reported actions of survey respondents in light of their expected price changes over the coming year. An increasing share of households wants to buy better value goods and services (in purple), and more than half of respondents are still cutting back spending and trying to save more (orange line), up from 30% in mid-2019. This is consistent with the continued lack of strong real consumption growth observed in Chart 2 . The survey evidence suggests that households’ experiences during the inflation surge have affected their consumption behavior even after inflation has moderated.
The large cumulative price level shift and scarring from it could continue to affect consumption in the future. The survey evidence suggests that consumers have become more sensitive to price changes overall, and adjust their consumption as a result. To test this empirically, Brandt and Panjwani (2025) estimate consumers’ demand elasticities of different goods and services. Chart 11 shows how demand elasticities of five expenditure categories have evolved relative to 2019. As demand curves slope downwards, more negative values represent more price-elastic demand, meaning that consumption quantities adjust more to a given change in prices. The sensitivity to price changes for most categories rose following the pandemic and energy shocks, indicating that demand became more sensitive to price changes as consumer trends shifted. Even as the inflationary effects of these shocks have attenuated, the price sensitivity has remained elevated in more discretionary (restaurants and hotels), and more energy-intensive (transport) sectors.

Elasticity (LHS) and elasticity indexed to 2019 = -1 (RHS)
Source: Brandt and Panjwani (2025).
Notes: The charts show weighted elasticities constructed from structural VARs of prices and quantities at granular consumption category level. The models are identified using sign restrictions and estimated on a rolling window basis. The price elasticity of demand within each consumption category is defined as the ratio of the response of quantities to the response of prices to a supply shock on impact.
Finally, we know from CPI microdata that I have presented before that the share of prices changing month-on-month rose over the high-inflationary period ( Brandt et al., 2024 ). Together with the evidence on higher price elasticities (and volatility, a topic I will return to later), these patterns represent an incentive for consumers to postpone consumption.
Household responses to higher interest rates
As a monetary policymaker I acknowledge that higher interest rates have a role to play in consumption weakness. Indeed, households are key to the monetary policy transmission mechanism. As inflation rose significantly above our 2% target in 2021-22, monetary policy had to respond aggressively to avoid inflation becoming embedded footnote  and to bring inflation back to target sustainably in the medium term. But consumption would be affected directly, too.
Raising real and nominal interest rates can reduce consumption through various channels – (i) by making interest payments on debt, particularly mortgages, more expensive, thereby dragging on disposable income and consumption (cash-flow channel), (ii) by higher interest payments on deposits and loans, which makes saving more, and borrowing less attractive (intertemporal substitution), (iii) by lowering aggregate demand in the economy, which reduces the demand for labor and raises the likelihood of unemployment, thereby dragging on wage growth, and (iv) wealth effects (such as lower house prices), which households may look to replace by increasing their savings ( Burr and Willems, 2024 ). In terms of explaining the consumption gap, this section will review research and empirical evidence on a subset of these channels.
How much of the current consumption weakness is attributable to tight monetary policy over the last few years? It is hard to exactly quantify this, especially in a time where various shocks are affecting consumption. We can, however, analyze how monetary policy has transmitted to aggregate consumption over the past, using local projections to evaluate the strength and speed of transmission across different types of goods and services. Analysis by Bank staff shows that a monetary policy shock that increases Bank Rate by 100 basis points can reduce domestic expenditure by up to 2% at its peak impact, and the effect persists over several years. The initial decline in consumption happens fairly quickly, with a reduction in expenditure observable after around two quarters. Monetary policy lags are therefore shorter than sometimes asserted.
When breaking down expenditure into goods and services, the analysis finds that goods consumption falls by more than services in response to a monetary policy shock (see the left panel of Chart 12 ). If we split goods consumption further into durables and non-durables, we find that the difference is predominantly driven by durables, as the right panel of Chart 12 shows. Durable goods are relatively expensive compared to non-durables, which means that if consumers buy them when interest rates are higher, they either forego higher returns on their savings, or face higher costs when purchasing them with credit. This means that the opportunity cost of buying them is higher, and hence their consumption is more sensitive to interest rates.

Real goods and services consumption (LHS), real durable and non-durable goods consumption (RHS)
Source: ONS and Bank calculations.
Notes: The impulse response functions are derived from a local projection model estimated over the period 1997–2019. The solid lines represent the median responses, while the shaded areas indicate 68% confidence intervals. The responses are scaled to reflect a 1 percentage point monetary policy shock to the target factor, identified using Braun et al.'s (2025) high-frequency shock series.
Goods consumption represents around 50% of total consumption. Within goods consumption, durables are under 10% of total consumption, and non-durables 22%. So, on balance, while the impact of monetary policy on durables consumption is notable, this effect is not particularly significant in explaining the overall consumption gap.
In addition to influencing realized aggregate consumption, monetary policy also influences households’ expectations (for instance of inflation, interest rates, or the state of the economy). When households are forward-looking, monetary policy can affect their consumption decisions much sooner than the results I showed in Chart 12 suggest.
I have previously highlighted the importance of new types of data and methodologies to inform my decision-making. To show an example of that, using high-frequency card-level spending data from the UK and Google search data, Brandt et al. (2025) find that in response to a monetary policy shock that increases the one-year gilt yield by 100 basis points, aggregate consumer spending declines by nearly 0.4% within a few days of the shock, shown in Chart 13 . This consumption response is predominantly driven by a decline in discretionary spending, which I highlighted earlier as an important margin of adjustment for higher-income households, who account for a large proportion of aggregate consumption in the economy. footnote  Their findings also show that web searches for terms related to unemployment rise contemporaneously, indicating that this result is driven by a deterioration of expectations about households’ economic prospects. Unemployment risk is a key driver of precautionary saving, too. footnote

Notes: The impulse response functions show the reaction of endogenous variables to a monetary policy shock which increases short-term interest rates by 1 percentage point. They are derived from a Bayesian proxy-SVAR in daily frequency identified by the path factor of Braun et al. (2025) . Shaded areas show 68% and 95% credibility bands. The model includes real spending on credit and debit cards in the UK, the first principal component of Google searches related to unemployment, online vacancies postings, one-year gilt yields, corporate bond spreads, and a measure of consumer prices.
This impact is driven via households’ knee-jerk behavioral response rather than the direct monetary policy transmission channels outlined above. But, this could still matter to explain consumption weakness through expectations. Buda et al. (2023) corroborate these findings using data from Spain, observing a substantial decline in consumption five days following a monetary policy shock. When aggregating the daily data to quarterly frequency, these effects disappear. Quarterly data could mask important dynamics which are captured by higher-frequency data, including a fast response of households via changes in their expectations. Further work needs to be done to better understand this high frequency, behavioral channel of monetary policy.
Let me now turn to the effect of rising interest rates across different groups of households. As I discussed earlier, with around a third of UK households holding a mortgage, the monetary policy effects on mortgage interest rates represent a large part of monetary policy transmission to consumption. Bank staff estimate that the net interest rate channel (which includes the cash-flow and intertemporal substitution channels) accounts for around one third of the transmission of higher interest rates to household consumption.
Taking a look at this channel more closely, using transaction-level data combined with administrative data on residential mortgages, Bracke et al. (2024) analyze how households’ consumption patterns depend on the flexibility of their mortgage. The authors compare households whose fixed rate mortgage expired during the tightening cycle to households whose fixed rate ended prior to December 2021 to identify the effect of higher mortgage rates on households’ consumption behavior.
Chart 14 plots the total monthly spending split by households who modified their mortgage when refinancing (in purple) and those that did not (in orange). A majority of observed households (around 70%) refinanced without modifying their mortgage and reduced non-housing spending persistently by around 3% following the refinancing event. By contrast, nearly one third of observed households used mortgage flexibility – such as borrowing against the value of their property (home equity extraction) or extending their mortgage term – to temporarily raise their non-housing expenditure by around 5% in the month of refinancing and to reduce their unsecured debts. The authors also observe a decline in aggregate non-housing spending by 2.5% across all households who refinanced during the tightening cycle, but the effect is short-lived. While the overall effect of higher mortgages rates is to lower consumption, households who modify their terms in fact consume more. These households could also be in higher-income deciles.

Notes: Authors use a difference-in-differences model with heterogeneous treatment and two-way fixed effects estimated over January 2021 and December 2023. Monthly dummies capture the months pre-/post-refinancing event interacted with a treatment indicator indicating whether a household refinanced during the tightening cycle. Changes in non-housing spending are indexed to the month prior to the refinancing event. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence bands.
Let me put these results into the context of current mortgage rates. While quoted rates on new mortgages have fallen since the MPC began cutting interest rates in August 2024, the effective rate on the stock of mortgages has not fallen yet. footnote  The higher share of fixed-rate mortgages compared to pre-financial crisis means the transmission of changes in mortgage rates to consumption via the cash-flow channel is slower. This means that the cash-flow channel is still weighing on consumption and is therefore an important explanation for consumption not having returned to its pre-Covid trend.
More generally, borrowers tend to adjust their consumption expenditure by more than savers, who are less likely to spend gains in interest income ( Panigrahi et al., 2018 ). As a consequence of that, higher interest rates redistribute income from borrowers to savers, and reduce aggregate consumption ( Auclert , 2019 ; Floden et al., 2021 ). This leads me to the next channel through which monetary policy drags on spending.
By offering better returns on savings and raising the cost of borrowing, higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of spending and encourage households to save more and borrow less. This affects the timing of consumption via so-called ‘intertemporal substitution’, which tends to be stronger among higher-income households, who have more capacity to maintain their level of spending by saving less from their monthly income. The literature finds this channel to be relatively small in the UK ( Havranek et al., 2015 ; Best et al., 2020 ). Moreover, recent survey evidence suggests that the impact of higher interest rates as a reason for saving more may have passed its peak, as Chart 15 shows (comparing the latest survey in green, to the peak in orange/purple).

I showed earlier that the consumption-savings assumption has underestimated the saving ratio in the context of the MPC’s forecast. Going forward, Bank Rate cuts might make deposit saving less attractive – and there is qualitative evidence from the Bank of England/NMG Survey of Household Finances in this regard. But households rebuilding savings as a precautionary buffer against emergencies, particularly in light of higher uncertainty and volatility, has become one of the dominant reasons for saving more in recent survey waves.
Impact of uncertainty on consumption
So far, I have discussed the impact of the inflationary episode and the resulting rapid rise in the price level yielding lasting changes in consumer behavior, and monetary policy through various channels as possible explanations for the consumption gap.
As highlighted in my speech about the Great Moderation, these shocks have also contributed to a more volatile and uncertain economic environment, which makes it more difficult for economic agents to make financial decisions. Alongside weaker consumer confidence, heightened uncertainty can encourage households to become more precautionary and build higher saving buffers, which drags on consumption. Research shows that higher macroeconomic uncertainty, in particular uncertainty about future GDP growth, leads households to persistently reduce their overall spending, including on durable goods ( Coibion et al., 2024 ).
Chart 16 shows empirical evidence that certain shocks increase both the first and second moments, i.e. the level and volatility, of prices. Specifically, I show the impulse response functions of the consumer price index (in aqua) and its volatility (in orange) in response to the same inflationary supply shock I showed in Chart 9 . This evidence suggests that inflation volatility rises and remains elevated for around four quarters following the initial shock.

Notes: The impulse response functions are derived from a structural VAR model estimated from 1997 to 2019. The solid line shows the median response, and shaded areas denote the 68% credibility intervals. The impulse response functions are scaled to increase the consumer price index by 1 percentage point at peak. The supply shock is proxied using a high frequency identified instrument by Känzig (2021) . Volatility is measured as the standard deviation of the inflation rate across the past 4 quarters.
Why does increased inflation volatility matter? Fischer et al. (2025) use a UK household survey to implement a randomized controlled trial with information about inflation forecasts to study the effects of changes in households’ uncertainty about future inflation on their consumption and savings behavior. Their findings show that households who are more uncertain about future inflation become more uncertain about their future incomes (see left panel in Chart 17 ), and reduce their income expectations. The information about inflation uncertainty also lowers respondents’ expected consumption by around 2.6 percent. The results suggest the presence of a precautionary saving channel – households want to insure themselves against volatility in their purchasing power by building a savings buffer.
Importantly, however, the authors show that the effect on expected spending is driven by households with high incomes and liquid assets, which underlines the fact that these households can adjust their spending relatively more to the uncertainty about (or volatility in) their purchasing power. As the top half of the disposable income distribution accounted for two-thirds of total household expenditure in the latest data ( ONS, 2025b ), their consumption share is particularly important for aggregate consumption and possibly the weakness thereof.

My outlook for consumption and monetary policy strategy
The main purpose of this speech is to share the disaggregated data and research that helps to explain the consumption gap, which provides a key perspective on downside risks to consumption growth, and by extension, economic activity. This assessment of risks to consumption is set against a background of persistently high inflation, and drifting household inflation expectations. Neither are target-consistent.
If the consumption gap was my only concern, reducing the restrictiveness of monetary policy would be appropriate. However, in light of elevated inflation and expectations, maintaining restrictiveness for longer would be appropriate. In determining the balance between the downside risks to consumption and the clear upside evidence on inflation, the key issue is whether high inflation itself plays a role in the consumption gap.
In my introduction, I justified my focus on consumption and savings by arguing that I have had to make important judgement calls regarding their trajectories in the outlook. Over the past few years, real incomes rose, as did real disposable incomes, albeit by less. These should have supported stronger consumption growth, and a saving ratio closer to the pre-Covid trend. Instead, however, a gap between real incomes and consumption has opened up and widened, and the saving ratio has not fallen back to trend.
In the most recent forecast, the assumption of a declining saving ratio to support more consumption again plays a key role (along with the assumption of modest improvements in productivity growth). It is challenging to measure the saving ratio and consumption – particularly as our understanding of the past gets revised, and the data are published with a lag. To improve my judgements on the future path of consumption (and savings) I have turned to forward-looking survey-based data, analysis of disaggregated historical data, and a wide range of research.
I summarize the survey data and research analysis on the consumption gap in two themes: (1) inflation and consumer scarring, and (2) channels of monetary policy and consumption.
For the first theme, inflation and consumer scarring, the research shows that the rapid increase in the price level has scarred consumers, even as inflation has moderated and real income growth resumed. The legacy of the inflation surge and price attentiveness continue to weigh on consumption and saving decisions, with a higher saving ratio via precautionary motives being one explanation for the consumption gap. Further, high inflation is associated with more volatile inflation, which makes consumption-savings decisions by households more difficult. The research shows that households who are more uncertain about future inflation become more uncertain about their future incomes, which reduces their expected consumption. This behavior is more pronounced for those with higher incomes and greater scope for reducing discretionary spending.
In sum, high inflation itself is behind scarring, income uncertainty, and weak consumption growth. Therefore, monetary policy needs to continue to focus on reducing inflation to achieve the environment of price stability. Then, households can return to their normal consumption-savings behavior which is conducive to stronger consumer demand.
The second theme – monetary policy and consumption – argues that restrictive monetary policy to date has reduced consumption, especially for mortgage holders who did not change their terms upon refinancing, and for savers taking advantage of higher rates on their deposits. If the monetary policy response was the key source of the consumption gap, then it would be appropriate to dial back the restrictiveness of monetary policy. But, monetary policy has indeed loosened, and staff estimate its impact on consumption to have peaked. Importantly, despite the role of monetary policy in sluggish consumption growth, inflation and inflation volatility and heightened savings have persisted.
In considering these themes to explain the consumption gap, the role for high and volatile inflation to scar consumers, raise savings, and lower consumption growth dominates and continues to be in the empirical evidence, which calls into question the assumption in the forecast that the saving ratio will fall.
It is perhaps counterintuitive that in order to create an environment conducive to growth, monetary policy must remain restrictive for longer. But this is necessary to bring inflation sustainably back to our 2% target in the medium term. My former boss Alan Greenspan (I started my career at the Federal Reserve Board) said it succinctly: ""We will be at price stability when households and businesses need not factor expectations of changes in the average level of prices into their decisions.” The evidence from consumer behavior is that we are not there yet.",https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/catherine-l-mann-keynote-speech-at-resolution-foundation,2025-10,"['explaining', 'consumption', 'speech', 'catherine', 'speech',

Uncertainty, structural change and monetary policy strategy - speech by Huw Pill
Speech
Thanks to Profs. Binner and Jayakody for their invitation to participate in this conference, to the Money, Macro and Finance Society for organising the event, and to the Birmingham Business School here at the University of Birmingham for hosting us all.
It is a great honour and privilege to deliver the Maxwell Fry Lecture.
Professor Fry was one of the leading figures in the field of money and finance in economic development. That literature was driven by four seminal contributors: Gurley, Shaw, McKinnon and Fry. I was fortunate to have the late Ron McKinnon as my doctoral supervisor in the early 1990s. As a result (and under the direction of Ron) I read and learned from many of Professor Fry’s papers – including, of course, his magnum opus ‘Money, Interest, and Banking in Economic Development’.  While I was never fortunate enough to have been taught by Professor Fry myself, I certainly benefited from his knowledge and insight.
Professor Fry also directed the Bank of England’s Centre for Central Banking Studies in the mid- ‘90s, setting it on a path that – in my current role as responsible Director for the CCBS – we continue to benefit from.
So, both as an individual and as part of the wider economics community, and along both academic and policy dimensions, we have much to celebrate in the contribution of Professor Fry to our profession at this conference.
Today I seek to offer a view of how rapidly evolving economic circumstances – greater uncertainty, driven by a changing institutional context and structural transformation in the economy at both global and national levels – are influencing the design and implementation of monetary policy.
I do not intend to discuss the immediate economic and policy conjuncture – the monetary policy stance. Nor will I engage in the minutiae of central bank operations – monetary policy implementation. That is not to say that these are unimportant or uninteresting topics. But you cannot do everything in one lecture. And I have discussed them recently on other occasions.
Rather I will focus on the implications of underlying secular changes in the economy for monetary policy strategy.
This is well-trodden territory in the academic and policy literature. And I should warn you at the outset that I don’t have much to offer in terms of novelty.
Indeed, the main message of my remarks this afternoon is the following: in a world of radical uncertainty and deep structural economic change, more weight should be given to robust ‘eternal verities’ in running monetary policy, at the expense of pursuing fragile optimising approaches specific to a given set of often ephemeral circumstances.
If that sounds like a call for ‘conservative’ central banking – it is.  The large economic literature extolling the benefits of conservatism at central banks is still relevant today.
But it is also a message that resonates with the seminal work of Maxwell Fry (1988) and his collaborators in the field of money and finance in economic development.
If we were to translate into more contemporary language, we might label that field macro, monetary and financial management in “emerging markets”.
The defining feature of an emerging market is its implementation of economic and financial reforms that fundamentally change both its internal institutional framework and its relationships with the rest of the world. In turn, those policy and institutional reforms prompt substantial changes in economic behaviour, and thus in the structure of the economy itself. Such initiatives both change and are intended to change the beliefs and expectation-formation mechanisms of firms, households, investors and entrepreneurs, ideally in ways that promote better economic performance.
The broad message of this literature is that market-oriented financial deepening can improve allocative efficiency, innovation and dynamism, as long as markets and banks are appropriately regulated and macroeconomic policies are stability-oriented and sustainable.  This insight lay at the heart of Professor Fry’s work. It remains relevant for today – not just in emerging markets, but also in advanced economies.
For our purposes today, the read-across to a developed economy in the modern era is: Monetary policy should be resolutely focused on price stability, even as institutions evolve, economic structure changes and uncertainty rises around it.
At a time when the UK economy is …
Facing substantial institutional change, owing (inter alia) to Brexit, regulatory initiatives following the global financial crisis, and ongoing disruptions in the international multilateral trading system;
Experiencing – at least potentially – structural change in key economic sectors, notably in price and wage setting behaviour by firms, especially in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic;  and
Confronting the possibility that expectations formation may have shifted, with households and firms paying greater attention to inflation developments in taking spending and investment decisions, with some price changes proving more salient than others;
… the messages offered by Maxwell Fry and his colleagues in the field of money and finance in economic development are surely germane.
Long overlooked by conventional macro and monetary economists, that important but under-appreciated literature and the lessons it contains are long overdue a re-hearing in the monetary policy community (and elsewhere).
On a previous occasion, I defined a monetary policy strategy as a systematic mapping from developments in the economy (‘data’) into policy decisions (‘instrument settings’) in the pursuit of the policy objective (price stability).
Be reassured, I am not going to re-visit that discussion in its entirety. But a few points are pertinent today.
At a time when uncertainty about many other features of the economy is substantial, it is even more crucial that there is no ambiguity about the objective of monetary policy. Defining that objective must recognise the constraints imposed by economic logic. And to remain legitimate, the definition must serve wider welfare goals.
One of the ‘eternal verities’ that I mentioned is the classical dichotomy: we should be cautious in assigning monetary policy responsibility for real economic outcomes because, over the longer term at least, all monetary policy can do is determine the nominal dynamics of the economy.
Price stability over the medium term is therefore the appropriate objective for monetary policy: it is both achievable using monetary policy instruments and, by creating a stable environment conducive to efficient longer-term investment and spending decisions, supports the innovation and dynamism that drive productivity growth and improvements in living standards.
Alan Greenspan famously defined price stability as a rate of inflation that was low and stable enough not to influence firms and households’ economic decisions.  The UK’s monetary policy framework takes this further, by defining an explicit 2% inflation target for a specific price index (the CPI), which holds at all times and penalises upside or downside deviations in a symmetric way.  This quantitative target is clearer and simpler than Greenspan’s definition, provides a benchmark against which monetary policymakers can be held accountable, and has helped to anchor longer-term inflation expectations.
The benefits of the inflation targeting approach have been demonstrated by recent experience. By contrast with what was seen in the 1970s and ‘80s, the substantial external inflationary shocks to the UK economy in recent years have not triggered a de-anchoring of inflation expectations and a non-stationary upward drift in inflation outcomes. Rather there has been clear reversion towards the 2% inflation target – admittedly not complete as yet, but nonetheless the clear direction of travel identified by the MPC, reflecting the restrictive policy monetary policy stance it has implemented of late.
Viewed through this lens, introducing any ambiguity into the inflation target or the MPC’s commitment to achieving that target is simply adding unnecessary and undesirable noise to what is already an undesirably noisy economy. A simple, clear, stable and unambiguous mandate for monetary policy expressed via an inflation target has shown its value.
Or – to put this into the language that most macroeconomists have in the back of their minds when discussing monetary policy (however arcane this may seem to non-economists) – when there is uncertainty about other ‘starred variables’ defining the economy’s steady state – the natural rate of interest, R-star; the level of potential output, y-star; or the equilibrium unemployment rate, u-star – monetary policy makers must endeavour to eliminate any uncertainty about their own objective, the inflation target Pi-star, and their commitment to achieving it.
Ensuring clarity about the objective of monetary policy leaves open the question of what policy measures are needed to achieve it. This is where the systematic mapping from data developments and analysis to the setting of policy instruments plays its role.
While Governor of the Bank of England, Lord King (2005) offered one account of this mapping.  In a benign world where institutions are durable, shocks are modest in size and the underlying structure of the economy is stable, policymakers and the private sector share a common view of the economy. Furnished with knowledge of the MPC’s reaction function and market participants’ forward assessment of the outlook for inflation, bond prices aggregate incoming economic information in a socially efficient way: in particular, in a manner that is consistent with – and serves the achievement of – the social objective of price stability. In this set-up, an inflationary shock is met by an off-setting re-pricing of monetary and financial conditions, which helps to stabilise inflation developments around target.
In other words, the credible commitment to an aggressive monetary policy response should inflation get out of hand induces behaviour that makes it much less likely that inflation will get out of hand. A virtuous, self-reinforcing cycle of stability is created.
But defining a systematic mapping from data to policy decisions is not only useful as a way of influencing the behaviour of those outside the central bank. It can also help structure, discipline and improve the discussions among and decisions of monetary policymakers.
In the end, policy decisions matter. Policymakers cannot rely entirely on expectational channels of monetary policy transmission – there will be occasions where they need to act.
Empirical macro models suggest that not all economic behaviour is forward-looking.  And – as discussed at the recent Jackson Hole central bank symposium run by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  – above-target inflation can be generated by real shocks to the economy (such as big shifts in the relative price of energy or food), as well as the nominal or expectational shocks that are more amenable to treatment by guiding private expectations.
The challenge is then to define how monetary policy should respond in this more uncertain environment – one characteristic of what former BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent has labelled the NAsTY (Not As Tranquil Years) decade, in contrast with the NICE (Non-Inflationary Continuous Expansion decade) earlier identified by Lord King.
In particular, uncertainty about the underlying structure of the economy – when institutions are evolving, shocks are large and economic behaviour is changing – needs to be taken into account. In that context, policymakers and the private sector are unlikely to share a common view of the economy. Even as policymakers seek to reduce uncertainty about their objective (Pi-star), uncertainties surrounding other starred variables – such as the natural rate of interest (R-star) or the equilibrium unemployment rate (u-star) – come to the fore.
One important implication of this discussion is that monetary policymakers should make a clear and credible commitment to achieve their price stability objective, which should be expressed as explicitly and unambiguously as possible in the form of a quantitative, symmetric inflation target. Another implication is that policy decisions in pursuit of that objective should be taken in a systematic way, both to guide private expectations and to structure and discipline internal discussions among policymakers.
To conclude, I believe these elements are well embodied in the UK’s monetary policy framework and remain crucial to how we think about achieving our mandate on a daily basis.

Diversion ahead − speech by Alan Taylor
Speech
Thank you for the introduction, and the kind invitation to come back and visit King’s. It’s an honour to speak here today, and I am looking forward to our fireside chat and taking your questions.
For me, King’s will always be a place of warm memories. It was on another October day, four decades ago, that I went up to Cambridge to read for the Mathematical Tripos. In 1984 I arrived at the gate from a small coal-mining village in Yorkshire with my happy but nervous parents in tow. I was the first in my family line to go to university, so it was a moment of great anticipation and anxiety, for them as much as for me, as I crossed that threshold. But we need not have worried—from day one, I could not have felt more at home in this college, nor more welcomed by students, fellows, and staff.
Arriving at King’s on that first day, and then as time passed, and even a little bit today, I always had a sense of wonder walking in through the Porters’ Lodge, thinking: I maybe do not know what comes next, what I will learn, or where I will go, but I sure am excited to find out. It’s a great institution that can make you feel that way, and I am very thankful.
Well, the journey, intellectual or otherwise, hopefully never ends – for me or for you – and I feel fortunate to be back here today following a career that has taken me around the world, studying and researching economics as an academic, and now, since last year, as a policymaker at the Bank of England on the Monetary Policy Committee.
The global economy at a turning point
Maybe drawing on recollections of forty years is a nostalgia trip, but when you get to my age you will also look back. And for me it also brings powerful reminders of the enormous changes we have seen in our lives since then, at home or across the world. That is true not least when it comes to the international economy, which has dramatically globalized in my lifetime. And that, as you might suspect, is the segue I need to introduce the topic of my remarks today.
I want to focus on one very important issue: the dramatic and disruptive developments we are now witnessing in international trade, and how they may impact the world and especially the UK economy in the months and years ahead, concluding with a discussion of the implications for monetary policy.
Specifically, I want to speak about trade diversion – what it is and why it matters.
First, an overview.
Trade diversion is a phenomenon where, due to changes in trade policy, i.e. tariffs, quotas, or other barriers, exporters are incentivised to re-direct goods to different markets when their usual ones become more expensive to access. The process may happen sequentially, if the set of countries imposing tariffs expands. It is therefore an almost certain outcome of the stream of trade policy actions we are now seeing unfold around the world, the only question being one of magnitude.
In total, however, when the dust settles, the world as a whole is almost surely worse off. Tariffs and other trade barriers divert activity away from the lowest-cost producer and towards less competitive suppliers. Although this is by design, in general, it does bring about an inefficient allocation of resources. In the near term, as we shall see, tariffs also tend to be inflationary for the country imposing them, and deflationary for partner countries, another potentially unwelcome set of shocks in the short run. And all this is before considering second-round effects from retaliation.
Recently, the US has imposed historically high and broad tariffs as shown in Chart 1 , for example on steel, aluminium, autos and parts, but also blanket rates on all exports from particular countries. The current estimate, as of now, of the average effective US tariff on all imports is 18% (The Budget Lab at Yale, 2025), versus 2½% a year ago, an almost 10-fold increase. This includes baseline and sectoral tariffs, weighted by country and import volumes. For some countries, the current levels of US tariffs are much higher than this average. The estimated average effective tariff is 28% for China, where 30%-35% tariffs have been imposed on most goods, plus some sectoral tariffs, with higher levels postponed during negotiations. Other countries also face high tariffs, like India, where two rounds of 25% tariffs have been implemented. These tariffs make traditional export flows into the US more costly, pushing exporters, some of them very large in scale, to seek alternative markets.

Of course, even beyond the recent US tariffs, there is a broader trend of trade policy being driven more by concerns about national security and strategic autonomy. The word of the moment is geoeconomics (Mohr and Trebesch, 2025; Clayton et al., 2025). As part of this shock, we have seen various protectionist measures being applied but also export restrictions and recalibrations of supply chains, sometimes called “friend-shoring”. All these measures affect the balance of supply and demand across countries and so may amplify the forces of trade diversion. Trade is going through a `great rearrangement’ (White et al., 2025) and it remains to be seen how much of trade is at best diverted, at worst destroyed.
Some trade barriers might be avoided, leading to an increase in trans-shipment and other circumvention strategies on the side of exporters. When direct trade is blocked or penalised, exporters may use third countries to ship goods or re-declare their origin in order to evade tariffs or restrictions. But these are only partial ways to offset the disruption of trade barriers, and they are often imperfect and legally risky. Moreover, the development of circumvention strategies generates additional costs that will still tend to depress global welfare relative to an alternative free-trade ideal.
What about prices and inflation? For third countries, trade diversion in reaction to an increase in trade barriers is most likely to have disinflationary effects because, from their perspective, incoming goods supply increases in the near term. This may not be entirely welcome. For example, concerns about trade diversion from the US to European markets have led the EU to recently create an import surveillance task force which is monitoring trade flows to identify “dumping”. Some EU measures are in place and more may follow, as we shall see. Logically, that could divert trade even more into fourth countries, like the UK.
In short, if trade diversion happens on a material scale in the UK, or in our closest major trading partner, the EU, then it is likely to have substantial bearing on prices faced by firms and households in the UK economy, for both final and intermediate goods. Those developments in turn would have implications for future economic prospects, and most importantly for the future path of inflation. And that is what matters for the MPC and its key mandate for low and stable inflation at a 2% target.
With that summary overview of trade diversion, let me try to look at the question in a bit more detail. And as I often do, as a way of organizing my thoughts, I will discuss trade diversion through three main lenses: economic theory, historical evidence, and the evidence from today in real time, such as it is at this point. Let me take each in turn.
Trade diversion in theory
In terms of theory, I want to walk through the basic idea behind trade diversion, which dates back 75 years to pioneering work by the economist Jacob Viner (Viner, 1950). He was living in another era, but it was also a time when large-scale trade disruption was afoot. The world was emerging from a protectionist phase in the interwar period, and the postwar multilateral trading order began to be built around GATT (later the WTO), bound together by the glue of non-discriminatory most-favoured-nation (MFN) rules. But Viner had glimpsed something new, and he had identified a weak link – that, as an exception, blocs of countries might form customs unions or free trade agreements, as a group of six European countries would in 1957, marking the origin of today’s EU.
Viner derived the implications, new ideas that could not be seen in a classic two-country trade model. For his logic, you needed at least three countries. And there then followed a set of classic economic lessons epitomising the Theory of the Second Best: trade might be created within the bloc as internal barriers fell, and that creation effect should be welfare improving; but trade would also be diverted, as trading partners outside the bloc might see their trading frictions increase, and that diversion effect would be welfare reducing. These countervailing forces had to be weighed up.
The proof, formally, takes a lot of algebra to derive the implications for quantities, prices and welfare outcomes in a general equilibrium setting. But this isn’t a PhD course in international trade. So, informally, let me derive a sketch of a result in a partial equilibrium setting, using a simple supply and demand diagram, and two important simplifying assumptions which we can think about later. We will have three countries and assume a global numeraire in the background and balanced trade. Suppose we are the home country 1, and we import from country 3, as does country 2. Initially there is free trade with no frictions.
Chart 2 shows the initial world equilibrium with no tariffs for this market at point A, where S3 (export supply from 3) meets D1+D2 (import demand from 1 and 2). Absent tariffs, the world price is P and is the same in all countries, and country 3 exports X3. Focusing on the home country, at point B the imports of country 1 are M1, and that leaves the remainder (the distance between A and B) to be absorbed as imports by country 2.
Chart 2: Partial equilibrium for a goods importer 1 and exporter 3, where importer 2 adopts a tariff
Notes: The orange line shows the export supply schedule of country 3. The aqua lines show the different import demand curves: D1 is the demand curve for country 1 only, D1+D2 the combined demand schedule when adding both country 1 and country 2’s demand for import in the absence of the tariff. Without the tariff, the global equilibrium is A with a world price P and total imports and exports equal to X3. Country 1 imports M1, country 2 imports the remainder, X3-M1. When country 2 introduces a tariff on goods from country 3 of size T, the combined demand schedule of country 1 and country 2 shifts to the dashed aqua line D1+D2’. The new equilibrium is A’ with world price P’ and total imports and exports equal to X3’. Country 1 faces the new world price P’. Country 2, however, faces P’+T. Imports by country 1 rise from M1 to M1’, while imports by country 2 fall to X3’-M1’.
Now suppose country 2 imposes a positive import tariff T. The price P will now denote the price in the free-trade countries 1 and 3, but the post-tariff price in country 2 is higher at P+T. Thus, as a function of P the actual demand for imports by country 2 shifts in to D2’(P) which is equal to D2(P+T). The new world equilibrium is at point A’ and the demand drop induces a lower price P’, seen in countries 1 and 3. The post-tariff price in country 2 meanwhile rises to P’+T. Total exports from 3 decrease to X3’ but total imports in country 1 increase to M1’. Globally, trade is falling (trade destruction), but locally for the bystander country, imports are actually rising (trade diversion). Home import quantities rise and import prices fall.
I think that, despite its simplicity, this is a helpful device to think about the first-order impact of asymmetric tariffs on trade flows and prices in a multi-country setting. And I will argue further that for the bigger and more important policy question – could these effects be potentially large? The answer is yes, and I will try to make that point two ways.
But I said I would get back to our assumptions, so let me detour to spend a moment on two important caveats about the theoretical impacts of tariffs. This is a newly invigorated field of research in international economics, after a period of relative quiet. Against a broader Whiggish undercurrent, a sense once prevailed that conditions of relatively free, or freer, trade would be the norm, so research moved on. But history is not linear, and new work has started to engage with the changing conditions we now face, building on older classic works in the field.
The first important caveat concerns balanced versus imbalanced trade. Classical trade theory usually starts from an assumption of balanced trade, that is, countries do not run persistent trade deficits or surpluses, whereas international macroeconomics now treats intertemporal trade and imbalances as the central case. A classic paper by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) was a rare attempt to draw the link and explain how lowering frictions in trade would tend to go hand in hand with wider global imbalances. Higher frictions go the opposite way – and, trivially, tariffs so high as to be prohibitive would mean autarky: and then, not just trade balances, but trade itself would be forced to zero. By implication, local changes in tariffs near zero might have second-order effects on imbalances, but the response has to be nonlinear as we go further. New work by Costinot and Werning (2025) digs deeper into this problem and finds that large tariffs can have wealth effects which impact trade imbalances, and that responses depend on the sensitivity of consumption patterns to wealth changes.
The second caveat concerns how the results may be undercut by changes in exchange rates. In the simple analysis above, the exchange rate is ignored. But the classic exchange rate argument has always been that a fixed savings-investment imbalance on the macro side would assert itself: If we want to consume more than our income, a tariff would be offset fully by exchange rate appreciation, restoring the quantity imbalance. But in 2025 the forecast of dollar strength based on this thinking went awry. Now, ceteris may not be paribus, but the classic argument may just not be right after all. Recent research has made the point that the exchange rate need not fully offset tariffs (Jeanne and Son, 2024). And, as above, a prohibitive tariff clearly would override this logic, too. But we also now understand better the connection between wealth effects to exchange rates, given net and gross international asset position (Gourinchas and Rey, 2005). Recent work by Itskhoki and Mukhin (2025) highlights this mechanism, noting the large US dollar liabilities abroad, and incorporating other drivers of exchange rates and risk premia. Despite the old conventional wisdom, in these more complex settings, the exchange rate offset may not operate, which matches what we have been observing over the course of this year.
Diversion then: In search of lessons from history
Thus, with these caveats in mind, the basic economic analysis can be a guide. And in that setup big tariff shocks will make a big impact through trade diversion. But how big is big?
To make a forecast of trade diversion and its impacts, economists need to calibrate a model. That involves two problems: First, it means getting the right model, from a wide menu. And second, it means getting the right calibration to suit the world you wish to simulate. The Bank of England, like other central banks and researchers, is using a wide range of models and calibrations to assess the likely impact of tariffs and conduct sensitivity analysis. You can see some of the results of this work in our recent Monetary Policy Reports and there will be more to come.
As we weigh up that range of evidence, I think history can also be used as a guide. And the obvious place to look is the experience of the 1930s, the last time that tariffs were raised around the world to the kinds of levels we are now seeing again today. And it was also a time when the mechanics of trade diversion went to work in a big way.
That is not to say that trade policy was the only economic problem in the 1930s. The interwar economic disaster was over-determined. The constraints of the gold standard imposed deflationary pressure in the 1920s and inhibited policy action after 1929; more deflation came from overshooting commodity supply in many markets; lasting currency misalignments after First World War caused imbalances and painful adjustments; in many countries a credit boom turned into a financial crash after 1929, with painful real effects from bank failures around the world (Kindleberger, 1973; Bernanke, 1983; Eichengreen, 1996).
Real economic activity collapsed in the early 1930s, and trade volumes thus fell in part as a result of the contraction. Some observers have therefore seen trade policy as a smaller part of the overall narrative of the Great Depression, but most analysis was aggregative and missed some important details on the composition of trade relevant for our question.
But recent research (de Bromhead et al., 2019) has studied UK trade flows in the interwar period at a more granular level to provide sharper evidence on the role of tariff policies and trade diversion. In the 1930s, the world trading system was rapidly becoming insular through multiple and often retaliatory beggar‑thy‑neighbour policies. The US imposed the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, at levels similar to today, but other trading partners were also putting up barriers. At a 1932 conference in Ottawa, the UK brought in Imperial Preferences, lowering tariffs within the Empire, seeking to boost intra-Empire trade and offset a slump, while raising tariffs on foreign imports from outside the Empire.
Here the evidence for UK trade diversion is compelling, based on disaggregated UK trade data for 258 goods and 42 trading partners over the period from 1924 to 1938. The authors use state-of-the-art empirical techniques for calibration and they find a large impact of UK trade policies during this shift towards protectionism. The changes in tariffs can account for about one quarter of the decline in UK imports between 1929 and 1933, in line with results also found for the US. But much more importantly for us, the discriminatory tariffs and quotas imposed by the UK shifted the origins of imports towards the British Empire. The central estimate suggests that the protectionist shift in UK trade policy can explain over 70% of the increase in the Empire’s share of UK imports between 1930 and 1933, and well over half of the shift toward Empire by 1938. footnote
And that shift in trade patters was profound, for the UK as well as for other trading blocs as shown in Table 1 , reproduced from the paper. The share of UK imports from formal and informal Empire trading partners rose from 30% in 1929 to 42% in 1938, a significant change in trade flows. Similar shifts were happening across the globe, of course. In France, for example, the import share from formal and informal Empire trading partners more than doubled from 12% to 26%. As each bloc turned inward, the effects of trade diversion on themselves and on others got further amplified.

Trade diversion showed itself on a large scale in the 1930s – just not immediately, but slowly and inexorably as exporters and importers adjusted over a period of years. The first historical lesson here is that the effects of trade diversion can be large when tariffs of this kind of magnitude are imposed. The second historical lesson is that these effects can take time to gradually materialize, as the rearrangement of trade patterns on this scale happens gradually. Prices and quantities will grind slowly to the new equilibrium.
History does not repeat and the 1930s are not a simple predictor of what will happen today, as so much else is different. Rather, this focused study warns us that today’s tariff levels, which are of a not dissimilar magnitude, could also cause a gradual but substantial rearrangement of today’s world trade flows. The impacts would be felt on quantities and prices and hence would have implications for monetary policy. So let me now turn from past to present and ask what, if anything, we see of trade diversion in the real time data coming in so far this year.
Diversion now: Tracking trade shifts today in real time
I now want to draw from a current, imperfect, and constantly expanding assemblage of real-time information and analysis that can give us the best sense of the extent to which we are now seeing the forces of trade diversion at work.
My main assumptions here are that the process will be slow moving, adjustment will go on for the next year or two, at least, and we will need time to see the effects play out. The effects will be seen first in the tariffing economies, and later in the tariffed economies. Under the presumption that the UK will not erect major new trade barriers we will be essentially a third country, an innocent bystander in this maelstrom of trade disruption.
How will we be affected? If some past exports from non-US locations may no longer get into the US given new barriers, where will they go? It is not just about our trade with the US. Some of our export goods will be affected, given less demand from the US, though the US share of our exports is narrow. That means lower prices for our exports diverted away from the US, all else equal. But it is also about our trade with third countries. Here a much wider range of our import goods will be affected too, where less demand from the US means more supply left over for us to absorb. That means lower prices for our imports, all else equal, as these other countries’ exports are diverted away from the US. The major countries or regions that matter here are the large exporters to the US that have been subject to even higher tariffs than the UK, with the major examples by trade weight being the EU bloc and China.
And digging deeper into policy actions and responses, there are a panoply of potential second round effects to think about. For example, the EU and China have taken measures in response and may do more. China has imposed large retaliatory tariffs on the US, even as the EU has mostly held back. Those measures will divert US trade into other locations, including the UK, adding further downward pressure on UK prices. But the EU has also set up monitoring of trade diverted into the EU, and has taken some measures to limit what they see as a potential dumping threat, especially from highly tariffed exports out of East Asia that can no longer make it into the US. Those EU anti-dumping measures will then entail even further diversion of goods into the UK, lowering our prices further still. The knock-on effects can stretch out as we wait for the new global equilibrium to emerge.
So what evidence do we see at this early stage of trade diversion at work? Let me point to a few pieces of incoming data.
First, let us look at the origin of these new tariffs. In Chart 3 , I show the value of US imports of Chinese goods as reported by the US Census Bureau since the year 2000. We can clearly see the growing importance of trade between China and the US after the Chinese accession to the WTO in 2001, only briefly interrupted by the Global Financial Crisis. That trend then flattened off, Covid happened, but still, tens of billions of dollars’ worth of goods were flowing from China into the US every month.
But we also see right at the very end the profound impact that the newly imposed tariffs between China and the US have had on bilateral trade flows. In the span of a few months, imports from China just about halved and now sit at pre-GFC levels in seasonally adjusted terms.

So, at a first glance, a key part of our theory appears to hold: that of a large buyer removing themselves from the market – causing the inward shift of the demand curve (for Chinese goods in this case).
The next question now must be, where are all those goods going, if not to the US? Contrary to what one might expect, Chinese exports to the world are up about 4% in the year to August despite the drop in US demand. In the next chart I am decomposing growth in Chinese exports into different regions. in Chart 4 , exports to the US are in orange and clearly contribute negatively since April of this year. We can also see, however, that they have been more than offset by increasing exports to the rest of the world, mainly other Asian economies but also Europe.

Going even more granular in the next panel, Chart 5 shows the contribution of some selected countries and regions to Chinese export growth in February to August 2025, that is, the months after the introduction of tariffs, over the same months in 2024.
Again, a second part of our theory stays intact: Instead of restricting production, Chinese exporters are finding alternative buyers to sell to. The EU plays a nontrivial role here, as does the UK once we adjust for the scale of the receiving region.

But what about prices? There are good reasons for why we should see trade diversion show up first in quantities and in prices only with a lag. After all, prices are sticky and determined by often only infrequently renewed contracts. In the short run, importers and exporters, and wholesalers and retailers, might all wish to smooth prices, buffering out of profits, until only later passing them through to their counterparties – a phenomenon we also see often in the case of domestic tax policy changes.
All that is in contrast to the equilibrium theory where everything adjusts at the same time. Still, there is some evidence already that prices are adjusting to the new reality of world trade.
In the next panel, Chart 6 , we see prices for Chinese trade goods both from the exporter’s (LHS) and importer’s (RHS) perspective. For the exporter, prices are little changed since the start of the year, and, since the renminbi has been flat vis-à-vis the dollar, so are Chinese export prices in dollar terms. However, the renminbi has depreciated significantly versus European currencies. So, for a UK or euro area buyer, Chinese goods have become relatively cheaper.

We can begin to see some of that effect show up in domestic import price indices (RHS). There now is a large gap between price developments for all US import goods (solid aqua) and those imports coming from China (dotted). It is plausible that tariffs have led to a change in composition so not all of the gap might be due to within-product price changes but to a shift towards relatively cheaper goods. Notably, however, going the other way, European imports from China have also already become relatively cheaper. So it seems like there are tentative signs that the final theoretical prediction, too, may be starting to come through: that tariffs between some countries spill over into price drops in third countries due to trade diversion.
And there is narrative evidence to confirm that the redirection of trade flows to the EU, and the lowering of the prices of these goods, has not gone unnoticed by the EU authorities at a time when a new import surveillance task force is monitoring trade diversion. Their latest heatmap shown in Chart 7 from September (European Commission, 2025) speaks to growing concerns about import surges, with trade flows from China drawing the most attention.

The rise in EU trade policy actions is also notable. In the news section of the website the Commission is listed as taking six actions in the entire calendar year 2024. It took less than two months to take six actions in 2025. And over just the first nine months of 2025, the total number of actions so far is 23, with China frequently mentioned.
It is worth noting here that these actions raise the prospect of a double diversion phenomenon, or a cascade of diversion. First, the US raises barriers on imports from low-cost producers, who then redirect their goods to third countries, like the EU, who in turn respond with further barriers to those low-cost producers, who then move on again to direct their large flows of exports to an ever-smaller target group of open export markets. Naturally, the UK comes to mind as one of those potential targets.
So finally, let’s turn to the UK. Now, in the grand scheme of things, the UK may seem to play only a minor role—you may have spotted it in the decomposition earlier, but it is hardly visible. Next to the three large trade blocs, China, US, EU, we are a tiny country after all. But that does not mean that what happens elsewhere does not matter for UK prospects, quite the opposite. Most of our imports actually come from Europe such that price pressures there will also mean price pressures here. UK goods import prices have been trending down for a few years now, weighing on aggregate inflation ( Chart 8 ). They are of course much higher than before Covid, as are world export prices. But I would expect this overall trend to continue and even to quicken as trade diversion picks up around the world, at least so long as the UK remains relatively open and takes few protectionist steps of its own.

Let me end with just an anecdotal example of this trend, and that is the phenomenon of imported vehicles, and specifically battery-electric vehicles (BEV). As the BBC recently reported, in the latest vehicle registration data for September, roughly 300,000 cars were registered in the UK; of these, more than half were electric, and about one quarter were BEV only (BBC, 2025). This is the first year when hybrids and BEVs have reached these milestones, and the growth in the hybrid and BEV segments is particularly strong, over 30%. And, significantly, among the ten best-selling cars in the UK were two Chinese models. With the US not welcoming such cars, and the EU applying protective measures, especially against the lowest-cost Chinese EVs, these trends may well intensify.
This anecdotal example only refers to automobiles, but I believe the same price pressures will unfold for many manufactured intermediate and final products. These kinds of developments are of a piece with the trade diversion story I am trying to tell. And I believe there is more diversion ahead.
Policy implications
Let me now turn to the monetary policy implications of trade diversion, and how I see them in the context of my view of the current macroeconomic outlook.
My current view is one of a preponderance of downside risks, which I see as having increased steadily over the last 12 months. The UK economy has slowed, and output has fallen below potential; slack has opened up in the labour market; confidence indicators of businesses and households have drifted to very low levels; and the trend of underlying disinflation has continued. Notably, disinflation has been led by the strong reductions in wage settlements, which look to end this year in the mid-3% range, and are likely to be closer to if not below 3% into the next year. As I see it, in an economy with rising unemployment and weak demand, wage settlements will be pushed down, and wage-led domestic inflation will not re-kindle an upward spiral.
Let me briefly show this chart which was also shown by my MPC colleague Catherine Mann last week (Mann, 2025). Every line is a probability density for the GDP nowcast in a particular quarter. Whereas, for the previous 3 quarters, probability mass was concentrated in positive territory – indicating an expectation of expansion – in the latest quarter, the aqua line, more mass has shifted left. From the perspective of this model, the likelihood of contraction in the third quarter of 2025 is now 27%, the highest this year.

For example,

Set against that, in terms of upside risk, most inflation expectation measures remain moderate. The inflation hump in 2025, while yet to dissipate, should do so in early 2026 when the taxes and administered price hikes from earlier this year roll off. Still, I see the upside risks to inflation as low compared to the downward trajectory in output and inflation fundamentals, and this view has led me to dissent in five of the last seven votes on the MPC in favour of a lower path of Bank Rate.
I now see three plausible scenarios in 2026.
The first scenario is the soft landing. I saw this as the most likely outcome in January as described in my first speech in Leeds. But the developments I just described mean that this outcome is receding in terms of probability. By maintaining what I think is a too restrictive path of interest rates, we may have braked too hard, such that inflation cannot smoothly return to target with the economy close to potential, as my votes have indicated.
The second scenario might be called the bumpy landing, one which I think is increasingly likely, a downside scenario, where inflation undershoots, and goes below target in late 2026, and the economy moves into a weakened state for a sustained period, with output and employment below potential, leading to undue damage to economic activity. Part of this scenario, in my mind, could end up resulting from some of the trade diversion pressures that I have described today: if we underestimate the forces of trade diversion washing up on our shores in the next year or two, our inflation forecast will miss the mark.
The third scenario is the hard landing, a deeper worry. This was a remote and low probability event a year ago, but the risk is rising. In this scenario, weak demand at home can lead to a more forceful downturn, where recession dynamics start to kick in that can be very difficult to contain or even reverse. The economy has been flirting with zero growth, and the realisation of negative readings could easily change the future path for the worse. The probability of this outcome is now not trivial. This would be the ‘downside to the downside’ scenario and it would lead to an even more dramatic inflation undershoot than the second scenario. To end up here would be a mistake.
I will be looking carefully at the domestic dynamics, especially in the labour market and wages, as well as output and business sentiment indicators to see where we are on these different possible trajectories. But I also remain alert to the risk that, as in our long history as an open trading nation, we may also be buffeted by significant shocks from the rest of the world.

The supply side demands more attention − speech by Megan Greene
In this speech, Megan Greene argues that the conventional wisdom that central banks should look through supply shocks needs to be reconsidered. She examines the UK’s recent experience with a pandemic and war in Ukraine to highlight lessons for central banks on how to think about supply shocks and adjust policy in response to them. She suggests that we are entering an age in which supply shocks are likely to be more frequent and severe, driven by factors like climate change and geopolitical tensions.
Speech
Introduction
It’s lovely to be back here in Glasgow - a city better suited than most for a discussion on the supply side of the economy and how monetary policymakers should respond to shifts in it. For starters, it is such a pleasure to speak at one of the nation’s great universities, which was once home to Adam Smith, who in his seminal work advocated for specialisation as a way to boost productivity. Glasgow’s shipbuilding and manufacturing capabilities continued to play a role in the UK’s productivity story during the UK’s industrial revolution. And the city now serves as a hub for research and innovation across a number of transformative industries, including sustainable energy .
Factors impacting the supply side of an economy can be easy to see in retrospect, but are sometimes difficult to identify and measure in real time. We often have to resort to other ways of detecting them. Perhaps most intuitively, we can identify a supply shock by its origins: as an event that changes the inputs to production, including their price, in turn affecting firms’ ability to produce the goods and services they provide to the economy.
Defined this way, different supply shocks are easy to imagine: wildfires destroying vital infrastructure and crops; a container ship blocking cargo from being transported through the Suez Canal; the discovery of new oil and gas deposits off the coast of Brazil and the introduction of steam engines and personal computers to make firms and workers more productive. Supply shocks can be negative or positive, with implications for activity, inflation and potential growth.
Such shocks are nothing new, of course. Of the 8 recessions the UK has experienced since WWII, supply shocks played an important role in at least half of them (Figure 1).    The Suez Crisis oil embargo played a role in the recession of 1957, oil price shocks featured heavily in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s recessions, and shocks to supply (as well as demand) were important in the two most recent downturns in 2020 and 2023. A rise in energy prices also contributed to inflation being above target between 2010 and 2013. footnote

When there is a specific event or a new discovery of natural resources, like those shown in Figure 1, supply shocks are fairly easy to identify. But some developments in supply are more structural and subtle in nature. For example, a potential rise in inactivity in the UK labour market following Covid-19 may now be weighing on labour supply. In these cases, origins can be difficult to identify in real time. We can instead define supply shocks by observing macroeconomic outcomes.
When there has been a supply shock, output and inflation tend to move in opposite directions. By contrast, demand shocks, which affect the willingness or capacity of households, firms, and governments to purchase goods and services, cause activity and inflation to move in the same direction, all else equal.
Demand shocks tend to receive the most attention. This is largely because generations of economists have learned to view economic fluctuations primarily through the lens of aggregate demand. This mainly began with the revolutionary work of Keynes, who argued that aggregate demand is the primary driver of economic activity, and continued with     New Keynesianism and Post-Keynesianism.
But to view economics through the lens of demand misses the fact that shifts in supply matter too. The supply side of the economy is often thought of as slow moving, requiring less constant monitoring than the demand side. But recent experience would suggest otherwise. The pandemic and a war in Europe have reminded us that the supply side of the economy can change abruptly and successive supply shocks can interact with one another. I am therefore going to focus on supply shocks in my speech today.
Central banks tasked with maintaining price stability don’t have tools to directly address supply shocks. Our tools are mainly aimed at demand management. Furthermore, supply shocks are typically viewed as temporary—an energy price spike, for example, or a pandemic. Consequently, monetary policymakers have tended to look through supply shocks. I think we may need to rethink this approach.
In the rest of my speech today I’m going to explain what the theory says about how monetary policymakers should think about supply shocks. Next, I’ll reflect on recent lessons learned from the successive supply shocks posed by Covid-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. I’ll argue that there will be plenty of opportunity to apply these lessons going forward given the high likelihood of additional supply shocks. And finally, I’ll explain how this all informs my views about the current conjuncture in the UK economy.
Supply shocks and the “four Ts”
The supply side of the economy is shaped by labour supply, capital and total factor productivity (TFP). TFP captures how efficiently labour and capital are combined to produce an economy’s output. A change in any one of these components can alter the economy’s productive capacity positively or negatively, acting as a shock to the supply side.
As a monetary policymaker, I’m interested in the supply side of the economy because it impacts inflation and economic activity. At the Bank of England, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is mandated by the Government to maintain price stability. In practice, this means keeping inflation sustainably at 2% over the medium term. Subject to that, the MPC also supports the Government’s other economic aim, which is strong, sustainable and balanced growth. Understanding the supply side of the economy is crucial to us achieving our mandate.
But there is a question about what central banks can do about shifts in supply in the economy. This is particularly the case when there is a negative supply shock, pushing output down and inflation up and forcing an uncomfortable trade-off for central banks between stabilising prices and output. In contrast, positive supply shocks tend to be viewed as less of a cause for concern given their ability to expand the productive capacity of the economy without being inflationary. For that reason, I will mainly focus my remarks today on the role of monetary policy in the face of negative supply shocks.
Traditionally, monetary policymakers have tended to look through such supply shocks. In a speech last year, Deputy General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements Andréa Maechler showed that the monetary policy response of advanced economies is, on average, three times stronger when addressing demand-driven inflation than supply-driven inflation ( Maechler, 2024 ). The UK’s experience has been similar; the Bank’s SVAR model suggests that changes in Bank Rate have historically been driven more by demand shocks than supply shocks, on average (Figure 2).

(a) The chart illustrates by how much, on average, the volatility of Bank Rate is driven by each shock identified within the model.
(b) This chart plots the forecast-error variance decomposition of Bank Rate from the Bank’s structural VAR model for the UK economy   (over the period Q1 1992 to Q2 2024 ( Brignone & Piffer, 2025 ). The model identifies 6 shocks. The orange band shows the sum of UK supply shock, world supply shock and world energy shock. The aqua bar shows the sum of the UK demand shock and the world demand shock. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods. The chart shows the decomposition of the pointwise mean implied by the posterior distribution of the model. The difference between the sum of the decompositions and 100 is due to unidentified shocks.
A number of arguments have been made, including by Maechler in her 2024 speech, for why this is and should be the case. They can be summarised as the “four Ts”.
First, supply shocks are often assumed to be transitory . That is, when a supply shock hits, it is not generally expected to have a persistent effect on the inflation rate. Instead, a supply shock is typically assumed to cause an immediate one-off shift in the price level, which will either fall out of the inflation calculation after one year (should prices not rise further) or potentially reverse if affected prices fall back to their pre-shock levels after the shock subsides. Given the “long and variable” lags with which monetary policy works ( Friedman, 1961 ), the conventional wisdom is that monetary policy should look through these kinds of supply shocks.
Second, negative supply shocks—all else equal—induce an awkward trade-off for policymakers. This is perhaps best demonstrated with a demand and supply diagram. In the left-hand side panel of Figure 3, we have an inflationary supply shock—for example a flood that destroys factories and houses and makes it difficult for people to report to work. Here, the shock causes a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve (in orange) from AS1 to AS2 as production is disrupted. This contraction in supply leads to a fall in overall output in the economy, from Y1 to Y2. At the same time, the price level increases from P1 to P2. Inflation and output move in opposite directions.
Let’s compare that to an inflationary demand shock, such as significant tax cuts designed to stimulate the economy – as shown in the right-hand side panel of Figure 3. The shock causes the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right, from AD1 to AD2. The price level rises, from P1 to P2 - as it did under the supply shock - but this time output also increases, from Y1 to Y2. Inflation and output move in the same direction.
Figure 3: AD-AS diagram: (LHS) an adverse supply shock and (RHS) an inflationary demand shock
When inflation and output move in the same direction like this, the required monetary policy response is relatively straightforward ( Tenreyro, 2022 ). If the economy is overheating as a result of excess demand, policymakers can tighten the policy stance, dampening demand and reducing inflation. Alternatively, weak demand can be met with a looser monetary policy stance, boosting demand and inflation.
When inflation and output move in opposite directions in response to a negative supply shock, monetary policymakers must weigh the benefits of stabilising prices through a tighter stance against the cost of weakening output. For this reason, monetary policy is likely to respond more cautiously to a negative supply shock.
Third, anchored expectations are assumed to restrict any further transmission of the shock through the economy. If households and firms believe the central bank will credibly achieve its inflation target and inflation expectations are thereby well-anchored, there is limited risk of second round effects emerging through changes in wage and price setting behaviour. Without second round effects, the shock should subside and monetary policymakers aiming to stabilise prices over the medium-term can look through it.
And finally, the primary monetary policy instrument—moving rates up and down—is, at its core, a demand-side management tool . It targets inflation through its impact on aggregate demand, not supply. It is also a relatively blunt tool, unable to act with precision by, for example, targeting a specific sector affected by the shock. Using interest rates to address supply shocks risks dampening activity unnecessarily in sectors outside of the shock’s immediate vicinity.
Lessons learned from recent supply shocks
These “four Ts” capture the traditional arguments for why policymakers should look through supply shocks. But a fifth “T” comes to mind: timeworn .
Following two major successive supply shocks—the pandemic and a war in Europe—most developed country central banks saw inflation peak well above their targets. Inflation reached 9.1% in the US, 11.1% in the UK and 10.6% in the Euro Area. footnote  More than five years on from the onset of the pandemic, inflation remains above target in the US and the UK. It is worth considering the lessons we’ve learned from these recent shocks so central banks might improve our responses to supply shocks in future. I think these lessons can be divided into two sections: 1) the nature and transmission of shocks and 2) policy responses.
When it comes to the nature and transmission of shocks, we have to consider that supply shocks themselves can be persistent. My remarks so far have focused on the impact of individual shocks on activity and inflation. But for reasons I’ll come on to, I think supply shocks are likely to become more frequent. This means that supply shifts in the economy are more likely to occur simultaneously or successively, leading to multiplicative effects on the economy.
We saw this in the wake of the pandemic. Bank staff have used a machine learning model to disaggregate UK inflation into domestic and global supply and demand factors, labour market tightness and a trend component that reflects second round effects as measured by core inflation, wages or inflation expectations (Potjagailo, Buckmann, & Schnattinger, Forthcoming, 2025). Figure 4 shows that at the end of 2021, global supply factors, including increases in commodity prices and supply chain disruptions, accounted for approximately half of the increase in inflation above the 2% target, with domestic supply factors accounting for around a fifth. Further successive supply shocks triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 continued to push inflation above its target in subsequent quarters, as seen in the aqua and gold bars.

Even if the shocks themselves aren’t persistent, some kinds may propagate through the economy long after the shock has subsided. Recent research by Bank staff examines the impact of different negative supply shocks on core CPI inflation in the UK, considering a drop in productivity growth, a fall in labour supply (owing, for example, to a rise in long-term sickness in the labour force) and a wage mark-up (perhaps because of greater worker power in wage negotiations). While a drop in productivity growth and a wage mark-up lead to the sharpest initial increases in core inflation, a negative labour supply shock results in the most persistent increase (Figure 5) (Munday & Paul, 2025).

The extent to which supply shocks have persistent economic effects depends in part on the extent to which second round effects take hold. These in turn act mainly through inflation expectations. In the wake of the pandemic and invasion of Ukraine, short-term household and firm inflation expectations rose rapidly (Figure 6). Recent research by Bank staff points to some important state-contingencies and non-linearities in the expectations formation process, which help explain recent dynamics in inflation expectations.
First, the level of inflation matters: firms’ and households’ attentiveness to inflation is greater during periods of high inflation, particularly when inflation crosses specific thresholds. According to Bank staff research, this threshold is around 3-4% in the UK (Gaffney & Potjagailo, 2025). footnote  , These threshold effects come into sharper relief the longer high inflation persists, and the UK has experienced near-continuous above-target inflation for over four years. The direction of travel in inflation also matters. Expectations are asymmetrically attentive to rising, rather than falling, inflation. And finally, the source of inflationary pressure matters. Expectations are particularly responsive to price changes in salient items such as food ( Anesti, Esady, & Naylor, 2025 ) and energy – both of which were particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine.

The recent inflationary episode has also taught us that it’s important to consider the state of the economy when gauging how much inflation expectations impact wage and price setting behaviour. For example, the degree of labour market tightness matters. Higher household inflation expectations are more likely to impact wages when the labour market is tight and worker power is greater. My previous colleague on the MPC, Jonathan Haskel, argued persuasively that the initial rise in UK inflation after the pandemic hit was due to successive energy price and supply chain shocks ( Haskel, 2023 ). However, these shocks had persistent inflationary impacts even after they had faded due to the tightness of the labour market. In early 2022, the labour market tightened rapidly and the demand for workers (reflected by the number of vacancies) began to outstrip supply (as proxied by the unemployment rate). The vacancy to unemployment ratio rose from 0.55 in the second quarter of 2021 to a high of 1.0 in the second quarter of 2022, well above its equilibrium level (Figure 7).

(a) The equilibrium V/U ratio is estimated using an error-correction model over the period 1982–2024. The real cost of vacancy posting and hourly labour productivity are included as long-run determinants for the level of vacancies. The model also includes controls for short-term movements in these variables ( Stelmach et al (2025) ). The final data point for the equilibrium V/U ratio is 2025 Q2.
This impacted wage bargaining — as workers negotiated for higher wages — and price setting — as firms passed higher labour costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices. This is captured in Figure 4 by the labour market tightness (pink bars) and trend (green) components of the CPI decomposition, which when inflation peaked in Q4 2022, explained around 40% of the overshoot in inflation.
Firm pricing may also depend on the state of the economy. Research by Bank staff, which uses the Decision Maker Panel (DMP) survey, points to key state-dependencies in the formation of firms’ own price expectations ( Yotzov, Bloom, Bunn, Mizen, & Thwaites, 2024 ). Firm expectations likely become more sensitive to inflation outturns in high-inflation environments. This is evidenced by the greater sensitivity of firms’ year-ahead own-price expectations to inflation outturns in the post-2022 period of high inflation relative to earlier periods of low inflation, which were also characterised by slack in the labour market (2017 – 2021) (Figure 8). Evidence from the DMP also suggests that there are asymmetries at play – a rise in inflation has significant effects on business own-price expectations, but falling inflation does not.

The level of inflation also interacts with the way in which firms set prices, influencing the frequency of price changes and consequently the speed with which supply shocks transmit to inflation. In early 2023, around 60% of DMP firms reported that they set prices in a        state-dependent manner by responding to specific events. The remaining 40% set prices in a time-dependent manner, adjusting prices at fixed intervals. Theory suggests that          state-dependent price setters should change their prices more frequently when inflation is higher to maintain margins ( Alvarez, Beraja, Gonzalez-Rozada, & Neumeyer, 2019 ). This is supported by DMP data - firms reported that they changed prices more often in 2022, when inflation was much higher, than in 2019. Most of this increase in the frequency of price changes was in state-dependent price-setting firms, who also saw larger rises in their input prices than time-dependent firms. In high inflation environments, the presence of state-dependent price-setters can introduce a non-linear response of inflation to supply shocks as firms adjust prices more quickly. This could at least partially explain why supply shocks have transmitted so quickly to inflation over recent years ( Bunn, et al., 2023 ).
To help further illustrate how the transmission of supply shocks is state-dependent, we’ve used the Bank’s core DSGE model to explore how a supply shock transmits under two different states of the economy. In Figure 9, the aqua lines show the impact of a one standard deviation supply shock in the model on inflation and GDP growth. footnote  We then model the same supply shock in a world in which inflation expectations are more responsive to past inflation (in orange). In this alternative state of the world, the supply shock pushes inflation up more than in the baseline and GDP growth down more.

Just as the post-pandemic inflationary episode has taught us important lessons about the nature of supply shocks and their transmission, we’ve also learned lessons about policy responses to these shocks. First, the appropriate monetary policy response to a given supply shock depends on the shock and the state of the economy. The scenarios the MPC produced in August 2025 can help to demonstrate this idea. Figure 10 shows our August 2025 baseline projection for inflation and the output gap (in white), conditioned on the market curve. footnote  This baseline scenario includes the continued impact of past supply shocks, alongside other factors. The orange line shows projections for a scenario with higher inflation persistence, again conditioned on the market curve. This scenario involves a different state of the economy, with more backward-looking inflation expectations, and a new supply shock, with weaker productivity growth, than the baseline scenario. We can see that inflation is higher and the output gap smaller in the inflation persistence scenario.
Figure 10: August 2025 forecast and inflation persistence scenario
Conditioned on the market curve representing Bank Rate

These projections become more interesting when we use them to think about policy responses. Instead of following the market curve, we use an endogenous policy path that evolves according to a targeting rule, which minimises the deviations of inflation from target and output from potential. footnote
This exercise, shown in the aqua line in Figure 11, uses a loss function to identify the best outcomes – in terms of inflation and the output gap – that monetary policy could achieve in the model, and the policy path that would deliver them. We can see that it suggests a more restrictive monetary policy stance than that implied by the market curve. This illustrates how the appropriate policy response can be affected by the structural features of the economy and the impact of an additional supply shock.
While this projection makes reasonable assumptions about policymaker preferences on interest rate smoothing and trade-off management, it should not be interpreted as representing the MPC’s view of the future path for policy, nor even mine. Indeed, a more restrictive response can take many forms. The policy path produced by the model implies a policy reversal that involves hiking Bank Rate in the near-term before pivoting back to cuts. I place a substantial premium on avoiding such policy reversals, as they threaten central bank credibility. A more restrictive stance that takes this aversion to policy reversals into account could, in my view, instead mean skipping cuts.

Uncertainty around structural features of the economy may also impact the appropriate policy response. Bank research finds that if policymakers are uncertain about the degree of intrinsic inflation persistence — as they may well be in the case of a supply                    shock — policy should respond more forcefully to inflation than under certainty (Munday & Paul, 2025). This result supports evidence from Söderström (2002) , which shows that responding forcefully to control inflation can prevent it from persisting in future.
Additionally, the optimal policy response to a supply shock may depend on whether inflation or output responds more quickly to monetary policy. Central banks often think that changes in interest rates affect slack, which in turn affects inflation at longer time horizons. If this holds, it is optimal for central banks to look through transitory supply shocks and only seek to stabilise demand shocks ( Kilponen & Leitemo, 2011 ). Lagged transmission of monetary policy to inflation means that any monetary policy response would feed through to the real economy too late to address the inflationary overshoot, and would only generate output gap volatility
However, several recent empirical studies using high-frequency identification methods suggest that inflation may in fact respond more quickly to monetary policy than output ( Cesa-Bianchi, Thwaites, & Vicondoa, 2020 ). This is especially plausible given inflation has exceeded the target over the past few years, so firms are likely to adjust prices more frequently. Ascari and Haber (2022) show that this leads to a faster pass-through of monetary policy to prices in the US. Research by Bank staff points towards a similar result for the UK – monetary policy shocks give rise to larger nominal effects when trend inflation is high ( Esady, 2024 ).
If inflation does indeed respond more quickly to monetary policy than output and the Phillips Curve is relatively flat, Bank staff analysis suggests it is optimal for policy to try and offset supply shocks and look through demand shocks (Munday & Willems, 2025). If the central bank has better, more immediate control over inflation relative to output, it should focus on delivering on the inflation part of its mandate.
While we’ve learned a lot from recent negative supply shocks, monetary policymakers should continue to develop both our processes and policy responses in anticipation of future supply shocks. At the Bank of England, we are partly doing this via a multi-year project acting on the recommendations put forward in the Bernanke Review             ( Bernanke, 2024 ).
As set out by the Governor ( Bailey, 2025 ) and Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy ( Lombardelli, 2024 and 2025 ) we are making comprehensive and substantial reforms to how we make and communicate monetary policy. This includes further developing our data infrastructure and modelling capabilities, changing how we use models and analysis as inputs into policymaking and placing less weight on the central forecast but instead considering a wider range of scenarios. All of this will help us have better discussions and make better decisions in general, but they will also help us to better gauge the supply side of the economy and adjust to changes in it in particular. We have already shifted from conducting an in-depth supply stocktake once a year to a more ongoing review of the supply side of the economy. Conducting scenarios has also enabled us to model states of the world in which supply capacity may be different to what is in our central projection.
Negative supply shocks here to stay
It is crucial these changes in processes and policy responses help us better understand supply shocks and how to respond to them because I believe we have entered an age of supply shocks. On this I am in good company; Fed Chair Jerome Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde have also acknowledged that supply shocks are likely to be more frequent and prominent in the future ( Lagarde, 2023 ; Powell, 2025 ).
In my view, future supply shocks are likely to be driven by two transformational trends: climate change and geoeconomics. It is incumbent upon central banks to understand the risks of these shocks arising, how they might propagate through the economy and how our policies might need to shift in response.
I’ll start with climate change.  My focus here is not the science, but rather the implications for the economy and monetary policy. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2024 likely marked the first year in which the global mean temperature reached more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above its pre-industrial average ( World Meteorological Organization, 2025 ). On top of that, the frequency of climate-related disasters worldwide has increased markedly in recent decades – as shown in Figure 12.
Figure 12: Climate-related disasters
Frequency

The UK is no exception; the Met Office’s latest State of the UK Climate report ( 2025 ) highlights that temperatures and rainfall are increasingly extreme.
Increased physical risks posed by climate change could cause material disruption to the supply capacity of the UK economy. Let’s take flooding, for example. A flood can destroy physical goods, infrastructure and machinery and may displace workers – as pointed out by my colleague James Talbot in his recent speech ( 2025 ). This negative supply shock could cause output to contract and inflation to rise. Indeed, research by Ficarra and Mari (2025) finds that a 1 standard deviation increase in the number of UK floods leads to a reduction in regional GDP of over 1% and an increase in regional inflation of about 50 basis points at the two year mark.
Physical events occurring outside the UK can also impact the supply side of the UK economy. For example, a flood in South America that destroys soybean crops is likely to place upward pressure on global agricultural commodity prices. These increased costs then filter through to the domestic UK economy, shifting the aggregate supply curve to the left. Thus, as the prevalence of such weather events increases, we can expect to see increased volatility in commodity prices.
Transition risks — associated with the move towards a greener economy — are also likely to generate negative supply shocks. This is most evident with carbon pricing. Bank research suggests a contraction in the supply of carbon allowances increases the carbon price, acting as a supply-side shock that pushes down on output and increases both energy and non-energy inflation for up to 2 to 3 years following the shock (Figure 13; Copeland, Brandt, Burr, & Wanengkirtyo, 2025 ).

To be clear, while the green transition is likely to generate supply shocks, it is less costly than not undergoing the transition at all or implementing it too late and too slowly. As my colleague Sarah Breeden ( 2025 ) has pointed out, measures to shift to a green economy can be costly for inflation in the short and medium term. But over the longer term, these measures should reduce the threat of negative supply shocks from physical risks.
Geopolitical risk footnote  has spiked repeatedly in recent years as tensions have risen (Figure 14) and economic integration has reversed. While the political aspect of geoeconomics is notoriously difficult to forecast, it seems likely the recent peak in globalisation is behind us and industrial policy and economic statecraft are here to stay for some time. These factors can pose negative supply shocks via many different channels.

One very direct channel is energy prices. Figure 15 illustrates the tendency for energy prices to rise following recent geopolitical events, particularly those involving energy producing markets. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is shown here on the left-hand axis and another two events on the right-hand axis. If such events become more frequent, we can expect energy price shocks to occur more often – pushing up on inflation and down on output.

More policy-led factors are also likely to generate adverse supply shocks. The impact of geopolitical tensions on economic interdependence can be viewed through the trilemma put forward by Edward Fishman in his recent book Chokepoints ( 2025 ). This trilemma posits that geopolitical rivalry, economic interdependence and economic security cannot all be sustained simultaneously. As geopolitical rivalry intensifies, governments must choose whether to prioritise economic interdependence or security.
The growing use of economic statecraft suggests that many governments may have chosen the latter. Economic statecraft - both a cause and consequence of geoeconomic fragmentation – involves the use of economic tools to achieve foreign policy objectives. These tools include tariffs, export controls, sanctions, investment restrictions and the exclusion of actors from financial plumbing.
While economic statecraft dates back to ancient Greece, footnote  it has become more prevalent since the global financial crisis, with the number of active sanctions, for example, rising sharply in recent years – as shown in Figure 16. Recent examples include the disconnection of Iranian banks from SWIFT, sanctions imposed on Russia by the US and its allies following the invasion of Ukraine, and China’s placement of export controls on firms linked to Taiwan’s military.

Such measures can restrict or distort cross-border flows of trade and capital, with implications for supply. A reduction in capital flows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI), could weigh on supply because of the important role that such flows play in boosting aggregate productivity ( Batten & Jacobs, 2017 ). Similarly, increased frictions in financial plumbing could result in higher transaction costs and reduced market efficiency, also negatively impacting UK supply.
The prominent use of tariffs this year underscores the growing role of economic statecraft in shaping the global trading system. Tariffs are typically thought to function as an adverse supply shock for countries imposing them, and a negative demand shock for those economies on the receiving end. But the economic fallout is not limited to just those economies directly involved in their implementation, with the overall inflationary impact dependent on a range of factors, including whether or not retaliation occurs             ( Greene, 2025 ).
The imposition of tariffs can have an adverse impact on the supply side of an economy by increasing uncertainty. The introduction and subsequent pausing of tariffs earlier this year was accompanied by a sharp tick-up in trade policy uncertainty, which remains elevated even now (Figure 17). Sustained uncertainty of this nature can impede domestic investment as confidence falls and firms delay decision-making ( Kohlscheen, Rungcharoenkitkul, Xia, & Zampolli, 2025 ). Indeed, research shows an increase in trade policy uncertainty (TPU) in the US reduced investment there by about 1.5% in 2018 ( Caldara, Iacoviello, Molligo, Prestipino, & Raffo, 2020 ). Reduced investment can weigh on the supply of the economy by limiting capital deepening and constraining productivity growth.

The index is normalized so that a value of 100 represents an article share of 1%.
In addition, tariffs can negatively impact UK supply as a result of their disruptive impact on global supply chains. Increased disruption can cause intermediate inputs to become more expensive, as well as generate more frequent supply bottlenecks. This raises inflationary pressures for all economies along the supply chain, even those not caught up in the immediate tariff action. This is a particularly important consideration for a small open economy, such as the UK, which is highly integrated into global trading networks ( Freeman, Key, Martin, Mulcahy, & Theodorakopoulos, 2024 ).
Sustained geopolitical tensions and further fragmentation could adversely impact the supply side of the UK economy. But one important factor to bear in mind is the speed at which this fragmentation occurs. Research suggests that an anticipated and gradual shift towards fragmentation allows economic agents to adjust their behaviour, mitigating some of the potential inflationary effects. If the rift is sudden and unanticipated, the supply side effect is bigger and fragmentation can force more stark trade-offs for policymakers ( Tenreyro, Ambrosino, & Chan, 2024 ).
Conclusion and monetary policy views
The magnitude and persistence of supply shocks can be very difficult to identify and measure. According to the theory, central banks should generally look through them. Supply shocks are often temporary, responding to them can generate costs in terms of output, inflation expectations are assumed to be well-anchored so second round effects can be avoided and central bank tools are poorly suited to addressing negative supply shocks directly.
Having recently experienced the double whammy of a pandemic and a war in Europe, however, we have learned some lessons about the nature and transmission of supply shocks and about policy responses to them. These will come in handy going forward, as we are likely to continue to face negative supply shocks as a result of, among other things, climate change and geoeconomics. The Bank is committed as part of its implementation of the Bernanke Review to continue exploring lessons from our recent experience with supply shocks.
For me personally, identifying the lessons we’ve learned from recent supply shocks is not just an academic exercise. These lessons also inform my thinking about the current conjuncture, and in my view suggest that the risks to our inflation outlook have shifted to the upside.
I think there are two main reasons to believe the supply side of the UK economy may have undergone a structural shift. Productivity growth in the UK has been weak in recent years, but even more so in recent quarters. In our forecast, we expect it to revert to historical norms over the forecast period. This would represent a rapid recovery, and I think the risks are firmly to the downside. Second, UK 16yo+ employment fell rapidly during the pandemic and still remains 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic peak. Given ongoing issues with the ONS Labour Force Survey, it is particularly difficult to determine how much of this is due to a rise in inactivity versus unemployment. If higher inactivity is a significant factor, that would represent a negative labour supply shock. Bank staff have shown that such shocks tend to generate more inflation persistence than other kinds of adverse supply shocks.
If we can’t identify a supply shock easily from its origins, then we can look to macroeconomic outcomes. UK headline CPI inflation has been generally above target for over four years and rising for about a year. As you can see clearly in Figure 18, the      year-long tick up in inflation puts the UK in stark contrast with our developed economy peers.

Contributions to annual inflation (percentage points)

The MPC expects services inflation to flatline at around 5% through the end of this year and core inflation has been flat since Q2 2024 and is expected to remain so through 2025. Disinflation has so far been concentrated in interest rate sensitive sectors, which suggests that the bulk of disinflation may have already come through. Meanwhile, underlying activity has remained weak with the labour market loosening and slack emerging. On the face of it, the data has the hallmark of an adverse supply shock.
Given these trends, some of the state dependencies that I’ve discussed today are likely to come to bear. Household and business short- and medium-term inflation expectations have been on an upward trend and remain elevated, with the former stretching the limits of what can be explained by price outturns. This is perhaps unsurprising given inflation has been in the 3-4% threshold at which expectations are particularly responsive to realised inflation. Furthermore, expectations are asymmetrically attentive to rising (rather than falling) inflation. Much of the recent upside news in inflation outturns has been from food price and energy inflation, both particularly salient for household expectation setting.
After Covid, the labour market was tight, contributing to rising wage growth and higher services inflation. Labour market slack has now emerged, so second round effects as a result of a shift in the wage setting process may not be a major concern. Wage growth remains above what our suite of models can explain. But pay settlements are coming down in line with the Agents’ pay survey, the DMP and our own wage growth forecast for the year. While the wage setting process may not have changed this time, the price setting process may have. According to the DMP, firms’ year-ahead own price expectations remain more sensitive to upside inflation surprises.
The risks of weaker demand have not disappeared, but to my mind they have diminished. I remain worried about weaker consumption and a higher savings ratio than we are expecting—so much so that I gave a whole speech on these dynamics almost exactly a year ago. But I am less concerned about a rapid decline in the labour market. Our metric of underlying employment growth has been very weak but relatively stable since the beginning of this year. According to our Agents, firms suggest that much of the labour market adjustment from higher National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and the National Living Wage (NLW) has already occurred. The historical Okun relationship between unemployment and output suggests the labour market has been easing in line with GDP. We expect GDP growth to rebound going forward, so if this relationship holds then a significant downside risk to the labour market should not materialise.
Risks from trade also persist, but I think they have abated somewhat. The US’s effective tariff rate is higher than it has been since the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act. But a flurry of trade agreements have been struck between the US and its trading partners, suggesting the risk of persistently high trade policy uncertainty has diminished.
What does all of this mean for policy going forward? Here, I think two of the lessons we’ve learned from recent supply shocks apply to the current conjuncture. First, when there is uncertainty around intrinsic inflation persistence, as there currently is, a monetary policymaker should respond to inflation. In doing so, one can prevent it from becoming entrenched going forward. Second, inflation may respond to monetary policy more quickly than output when inflation has exceeded the target for an extended period and firms are likely to adjust prices more frequently. In this environment, monetary policymakers should offset supply shocks.
Responding to inflation can take many forms. In the scenario I showed earlier with higher inflation persistence resulting from more backward-looking inflation expectations and weaker productivity growth, the endogenous policy path was more restrictive than the market curve and involved near-term rate hikes. This endogenous path should not be taken as gospel. As I’ve said, I am not in favour of policy reversals by central banks. Instead, I believe an appropriate response to the uncertainty and risks we are currently facing should involve a cautious approach to rate cuts going forward.

On QT − remarks by Huw Pill
In this set of remarks, Huw Pill discusses his preference for maintaining the existing pace of QT, in contrast to the majority decision at the September MPC meeting. He discusses the challenging environment in which the recent QT decision was taken emphasizing the weight he places on maintaining continuity and consistency as a driver for his vote.
Remarks
Thanks to the Pictet Research Institute for their invitation to participate in their inaugural symposium.
It is a great honour and pleasure to engage with such a distinguished group of academics and practitioners on contemporary issues of monetary policy.
Those issues are many, inter-related and complex.
While I don’t expect to attract much sympathy in making this remark, we live in challenging times for monetary policy makers like me!
This morning, I will focus on one such monetary policy issue: the pace at which central banks should shrink their balance sheets via ‘quantitative tightening’ (QT).
QT entails reducing the stock of bonds (typically government bonds) held by central banks for monetary policy purposes whose purchase was financed by the creation of reserves. It represents the unwinding of previous quantitative easing (QE).
I hope you will permit some parochialism here, as I will discuss this issue in a UK context.
I appreciate that this discussion may seem a little ‘niche’ or narrow to an international audience. But it sits within a broader web of institutional and policy questions relating to monetary policy and central bank independence. These are topics of global concern.
Last week the Bank of  England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced a slowing in the pace of QT from £100bn per year to £70bn per year. This decision was taken on the grounds that a number of factors – larger term premia on long-term government bonds, greater global economic policy uncertainty, and weaker demand for longer-term government debt stemming from structural changes in the UK bond market – may have increased the risk that QT would disrupt on market functioning.
There are certainly risks in this direction and I recognise that these have to be addressed pragmatically by the UK authorities.
Nonetheless, I dissented from the majority MPC view on this issue, favouring instead a continuation of the £100bn annual pace of QT that has been implement in recent years.  This dissent reflects the high weight I place on maintaining continuity and consistency in the MPC’s approach to QT.
In the remainder of my remarks this morning, I will expand on my reasons for this dissent.
In August 2021, the MPC set out a set of principles to govern the implementation of QT in its Monetary Policy Report footnote  . Paraphrasing that document (in the form adopted in recent MPC communication) footnote  :
The Committee has a preference to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy;
Sales would be conducted so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets , and only in appropriate conditions; and
To help achieve that, sales would be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner over a period of time.
These principles have served the MPC well.
They have helped keep QT “in the background” (to quote an oft-used phrase).
This has helped to support the clarity and simplicity of our monetary policy communication around the “active” Bank Rate instrument. The approach has also been honest and transparent: the MPC has neither used QT as an active monetary policy instrument nor discussed doing so.
Clarity, simplicity, honesty and transparency are cornerstones of effective central bank communication. Our experience with QT has demonstrated this, representing a (perhaps rare) example of where they work to reinforce on another rather than exhibiting trade-offs among themselves.
To be clear, operating “in the background” does not mean (at least to me) that QT has no effect on yields (and wider financial conditions). The evidence suggests there has been a modest impact. footnote
What permits QT to operate “in the background” is the scope for Bank Rate (as the “active instrument”) to establish a policy stance that delivers inflation sustainably at target given the impact of QT on yields. With Bank Rate away from its effective lower bound and able to change in either direction, this is the environment in which QT has operated in recent years.
Operating within our established principles has allowed the market to price the impact of QT and has thereby allowed the MPC to set Bank Rate to achieve the inflation target given the impact of QT – as well as a multitude of other factors – on the yield curve, bank behaviour and wider financial and credit decisions.
Just to emphasise, taking Bank Rate decisions given market pricing of yields and bank credit and loan choices is an entirely standard part of the policy setting process.
Operating gradually and predictably – and making QT announcements early in the autumn policy process – allows QT decisions to be digested and priced by the market before the Bank of England staff develop the analyses and forecasts upon which its November Monetary Policy Report and concurrent Bank Rate decision are based.
I recognise that the world does not stand still. Principles established in 2021 (before I joined the MPC) are not sacrosanct. And decisions taken on the basis of those principles may need to evolve as the wider environment evolves.
Market conditions have changed, with greater pressure on long rates as demand from defined benefit (DB) pension schemes recedes.
Fiscal conditions have changed, with the UK’s debt management office (DMO) issuance rising as challenges to public finances intensify.
Risks to market functioning have increased – not just in the interbank money market (where QT’s impact on the outstanding stock of central bank reserves may be most relevant) but also in the gilt repo markets central to non-bank financial institution (NBFI)’s activity that is gaining in importance relative to bank finance in the transmission of monetary policy.
These are all legitimate concerns that deserve thoughtful analysis and responses.
But I am not convinced that these changes are either being driven by QT or that QT should address their implications.
On that basis, I favoured a different balance between slowing QT to manage risks to market functioning versus maintaining consistency and continuity in the implementation of QT (and thus running down the portfolio of government debt held for monetary policy purposes more quickly) relative to the majority of the MPC.
At best, slowing QT is a temporary and indirect palliative, likely dominated in terms of effectiveness by other tools. And the danger exists that measures to treat the symptoms simply allow the underlying drivers to continue for longer and in greater force, making the eventual denouement more painful all around.
For me, both structural challenges to public debt management and concerns about core market functioning are better dealt with via other means than QT.
There are both institutional and effectiveness aspects to this assertion.
It is when responsibilities are blurred that policy maker accountability and independence are most at risk.
And I have faith in the tools that have been designed and introduced to support market functioning (such as the financial stability operations initiated in October 2022 in the face of the LDI / mini budget episode or the contingent NBFI gilt repo facility footnote  ). If QT (which was not designed with that function in mind) is portrayed as the first line of defence in this regard, I worry about the risk of undermining them.
I hope I have convinced why I voted to maintain the pace of QT at £100 billion over the coming year. It was driven by a motivation to provide continuity and consistency in the MPC’s approach, particularly as gilt market developments had been predominantly unrelated to QT.
And with that, I am happy to take your questions.

Bumps in the road? − speech by Sarah Breeden
Speech
Introduction
Good afternoon and thank you for the invitation to speak here at Cardiff Business School. It’s a real pleasure to be here in Cardiff – a city that has shown the world the value of teamwork, whether through rugby at the Principality Stadium or in its history as a hub of global trade, as well as the importance of innovation, as exemplified by the regeneration of Cardiff Bay. Similarly, Cardiff Business School has been at the forefront of nurturing future leaders and thinkers, equipping them with the skills to navigate the ever-changing economic landscape. It is the economic landscape that I wish to focus on today. And specifically, the path that inflation has taken over the past year.
Inflation has come down significantly since it hit double figures in late 2022, supported by the restrictive stance of monetary policy. But the road has not been smooth. Having fallen back to our 2% target last year, headline inflation has risen again, back up to 3.8% in the latest data for August. And we think it will have increased again to around 4% for September.
This is too high. While we expect inflation to begin to fall back from next month and gradually return to target thereafter, it is right that we question the risks around this projection. Specifically, does this latest “hump” in inflation represent a mere “bump” in the road? Or is it a sign that the disinflationary process is veering off track – that inflation is proving sticky not bumpy, meaning our hump is in fact a plateau?
As I do, I’ll look at this through three lenses:
What new shocks have we faced and are they likely to generate additional second-round effects?
Are the old shocks playing out as expected or is there news we need to respond to?
What have we learnt about the impact of our policy? I will then look to bring this all together and set out what it means for my policy approach going forward.
What new shocks have we faced?
This “hump” has not been a surprise. Indeed, the MPC had been forecasting a pick-up in inflation over 2025 since the time of the February MPR, with inflation then expected to rise to 3.5% in June and to peak at around 3.7% in Q3 (Figure 1). And the increase reflected factors largely unrelated to domestic inflationary forces – what I will call “external” factors – such as administered prices like water, tax and previous falls in energy prices dropping out of the annual comparison.

We have received some upside news since then, with inflation now expected to peak a little higher, reaching 4.0% in September. This news too has largely reflected external factors. Using the May MPR for comparison footnote  , upside news to energy and food prices accounts for almost all of the surprise (Figure 2), with the stronger than expected outturns for services inflation in April and July explained by administered or erratic factors, such as recent volatility in airfares footnote  .

The projection for September shows the component-level decomposition of the news between the Bank staff projection at the time of the August 2025 MPR and the May 2025 MPR.
The rise in UK food price inflation, which reached 5.1% in August, reflects in large part a sharp increase in some agricultural commodity prices and so provides little signal on domestic inflationary pressures. Part of that rise in agricultural prices reflects adverse weather events. As I set out in a speech earlier this year ( Breeden, 2025 ), severe weather events can have significant impacts on agricultural commodity prices. And, as an economy that imports a high proportion of its food – around 40% footnote  – UK inflation is highly susceptible to such changes. Indeed, over the past year droughts in major coffee-producing regions like Brazil and heavier than usual rainfall and plant diseases in some cocoa producing regions in Africa have pushed up on prices.
There are likely to be some UK-specific factors at play too behind the rise in food prices. The increase in the National Living Wage and the change to the threshold at which employers start paying NICs are thought to have pushed labour costs higher. A new framework to reduce packaging waste (EPR) has also provided some upward pressure.
Are these likely to lead to additional second-round effects?
Externally driven cost shocks like these matter most when they lead to inflation persistence – or second round effects – when wages and other prices increase in response, keeping inflation higher for longer. Such second-round effects were important following the 2022 inflationary episode.
It has long been our central case that this “hump” in inflation would not lead to additional second-round effects. In comparison to our experience in 2022, the peak is expected to be much lower (almost a third of the size), the labour market is much looser and the demand environment weaker, all of which mean that the chance of follow-on wage and price rises is much lower. Notwithstanding the recent upside surprise in inflation I just described, all three of these things still hold true.
Nevertheless, the significant rise in household inflation expectations since the recent lows in 2024 has given me some pause for thought (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Household inflation expectations (a)
Sources: Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation attitudes Survey, Citigroup, YouGov and Bank of England calculations.
(a) Bank/Ipsos data show the median responses from the Bak/Ipsos IAS. A methodological break occurred during the Covid pandemic that means a degree of caution should be taken when making long-run comparisons with these data. The methodology notes linked in the latest IAS release for February 2025 provide more information. Data are not seasonally adjusted and the latest data points are for 2025 Q3. Since August 2022, the YouGov/Citigroup survey has been based on updated response buckets. Data are not seasonally adjusted and the latest data points are for September 2025. Dashed lines represent the series averages over 2010-19.
That household inflation expectations should rise in response to realised inflation is not unexpected ( Weber et al, 2022 ), particularly during periods of high inflation ( Pfauti 2024 ). But we have seen, in addition, an increase in the sensitivity of expectations to food prices. Indeed recent Bank staff analysis extending Anesti et al (2025) shows that the sensitivity of household inflation expectations to food prices has almost doubled in recent years footnote  (Figure 4). Since household inflation expectations can influence pay demands in the wage-bargaining process, if expectations were to continue to rise with further increases in food prices, this could be a cause for concern.
Figure 4: Households’ near-term inflation expectations have been particularly sensitive to developments in food price inflation (a)
Sources: Citigroup, ONS, YouGov and Bank calculations.
(a) The chart shows the estimated coefficients from regressions of changes in Citi/YouGov one year ahead household inflation expectations on changes in the contributions of food price inflation and core CPI inflation to headline CPI inflation. The pre-2022 estimation period runs from 2005 Q1 to 2021 Q4, while the post-2022 estimation period runs from 2022 Q1 to 2025 Q2.
Whether the rise in household inflation expectations ultimately passes through into higher wages depends also on the outlook and behaviour of firms. Evidence from the literature suggests that, similar to households, firms’ expectations are sensitive to current inflation, and this sensitivity can increase during high inflation episodes ( Yotzov et al, 2024 ). Recent moves in firms’ inflation expectations have though been much more muted than those of households (Figure 5).
Figure 5: DMP respondents’ CPI and own-price inflation expectations (a)
Sources: DMP Survey and Bank calculations.
(a) CPI expectations are based on the questions “As a percentage, what do you think the annual CPI inflation will be in the UK, both one year from now and three years from now?”. Own-price expectations are based on the question ‘Looking ahead, 12 months from now, what approximate percentage change in your average price would you expect in each of the following scenarios: lowest, low, middle, high, highest’. Respondents were then asked to assign a probability to each scenario. A point estimate is constructed by combining the five scenarios with the probabilities attached to them. Firms that do not set regular prices are not asked about their own-price expectations. All series are presented as three-month moving averages.
There is little evidence in the literature to suggest conclusively whether firms’ or households’ expectations ultimately matter most for wage growth. That said, only around 10% of households in the latest Bank/Ipsos survey say they will respond to higher inflation expectations by pushing for higher pay with their current employer. This share has been broadly unchanged for the past ten years, despite the recent rise in wage growth, suggesting perhaps that firms’ rather than households’ expectations matter most.
The relative importance of firms’ and households’ inflation expectations is likely also to be state dependent. I find it plausible that the bargaining power of firms is greater when the labour market is looser. And so it is important context that a range of indicators point to a significant degree of slack having opened up in the labour market recently. Covid-aside, the unemployment-to-vacancies ratio is at levels not seen since 2015 and the balance between staff availability and demand in the REC survey is at levels not seen since 2008. Net desired hours wanted by workers are now also at levels not seen since 2015.
We need also to consider how firms would react to any additional wage pressure. The weaker demand environment, compared to 2022, reduces their ability to pass wage increases through to prices, making it more likely that any increase will be absorbed in firms’ margins. Indeed, the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) suggests firms are now more concerned about demand than inflation. In late 2022, around twice as many firms in the BICS were concerned about rising inflation as were concerned about falling demand. As of September this year, that ratio has inverted.
Are old shocks playing out as expected?
In addition to understanding new shocks, we must of course also monitor whether disinflation from the ‘old’ 2022 shock is continuing as we expected, particularly given the noticeable stalling in the downward trajectory of services price inflation over 2025.
Services consumer price inflation has been broadly flat over recent months, at a little under 5%. This remains notably above target consistent levels (around 3%) and above levels recorded in other advanced economy regions, such as the Euro Area, where it is running closer to 3%. This could be taken as a signal that the disinflationary process from the 2022 shock is veering off track in the UK, with persistence taking longer to dissipate and with our hump turning into a plateau.
Much of this apparent slowing in disinflation can in fact be explained by the administered prices I described earlier. And as my colleague Swati Dhingra points out in an recent op-ed, these can also help explain a chunk of the difference in services price inflation between the UK and the Euro Area (Figure 6, LHS). Inflation in services set by administered and indexed prices, such as water bills and education, combined with private rent growth, is three times higher in the UK than in the Euro Area, while prices in “market-based” services such as leisure and hospitality grew at similar rates. Indeed, the recent increase in UK administered pries, combined with the lingering strength in private rent growth, explains over 90% of the EA-UK services inflation gap.
Figure 6: UK and Euro Area services price inflation by category in August 2025 and measures of underlying services inflation (a)(b)
Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.
(a) Administered and indexed prices as sewerage, dental, vehicle excise duty, tram, underground and bus transport, communications, TV licence fees, social rents, and education which comprise one-quarter (24%) of the UK services basket. Euro Area inflation statistics do not separate out private and social rents in HICP. We typically consider social rents to be administered, so include both private and social rents with administered prices for both the UK and Euro Area. Including rents within market-based services does not materially alter the story.
(b) The low variance measure is calculated by weighting each component of services inflation by the inverse variance of the change in 12-month inflation of that component from 12 months previously. The maximum adjusted weight is capped at twice its original value. The trimmed mean measure excludes the 10% largest and 10% smallest price changes. The latest data points shown refer to August 2025.
We can also take some comfort that the disinflation process is continuing from measures of underlying services price inflation, which have continued to fall back (Figure 6, RHS). But even these measures remain at levels above what would be considered target consistent.
This strength in services inflation appears to reflect persistence in wage growth, rather than additional persistence in firms’ pricing behaviour. A simple Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) model estimated by Bank staff, shows that the level of core services inflation (excluding rents) seen since mid-2023 can be well explained by wage growth and producer price inflation (Figure 7). There was some unexplained strength in 2025 Q2, but this can be rationalised by those unusually strong increases in administered prices I described earlier.
Figure 7: ARDL estimates of contributions to quarterly core services inflation, excluding rents (a)
Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.
(a) Estimated contributions to core services inflation excluding rents are based on autoregressive distributed lag regressions of services inflation on metrics of pay growth and manufacturing PPI inflation.
While wage growth continues to fall back, it remains above levels that can be explained by economic fundamentals. The latest intelligence from our Agents however continues to suggest that pay growth will fall back to around 3.7% by the end of the year – a level that is consistent with the latest data on pay settlements too. This outlook is pretty much unchanged on the start of the year. And this suggests to me that there is little to suggest that persistence in wage growth will prove any more sticky in light of the “hump” than we had anyway expected.
Looking further ahead, wage growth is expected to fall back further over 2026. Year-ahead expectations for wage growth in the DMP Survey have crept down further to around 3.6%.and I expect this in turn to pass through to lower services price inflation.
Taken together, therefore, I judge the underlying disinflationary process from past shocks to remain on track. Wage growth has fallen back and I have little reason not to believe it will continue to do so as we look ahead, bringing services inflation lower alongside it.
What have we learnt about the impact of policy?
Of course past increases in Bank Rate have contributed to this disinflationary process by weighing on demand.
We set out our latest model-based estimates for the impact of Bank Rate in the August MPR (Figure 8). Precise estimates of the impact are inevitably uncertain, and there is evidence to suggest that the relationship can change over time ( Mumtaz, 2010 ). This could result from non-linear or asymmetric effects of monetary policy ( Stenner, 2022 ) or from underlying changes in the structure of the economy.
Figure 8: Estimated contribution of the overnight index swap curve (OIS) to the level of GDP (a)
Sources: Bank of England, ONS and Bank calculations.
(a) The estimates for the contribution of the OIS curve to the level of UK GDP are the sum of the impacts on consumption, business investment, housing investment and the net imports offset in the MPC’s baseline projections. The net imports offset component reflects that part of the reduction in consumption from higher interest rates will arise from lower spending on imported goods, which mechanically pushes up GDP. These estimates are based on the standard treatment of the impact of changes in Bank Rate and the OIS curve in the Bank’s forecasting models. Bank staff estimate the impact of changes in the OIS curve between each Monetary Policy Report on the level of GDP, and these are then summed to obtain estimates of the total contributions. The estimates incorporate an impact from changes in the OIS curve on the level of GDP that persists over several years. The level of the aqua bars in the first data point in 2021 Q3 therefore reflects the estimated impact on demand of changes in the OIS curve from several years prior to that date. The effects of the estimated impact of changes in the OIS curve on sterling exchange rates have been excluded. The final data are for 2025 Q2.
These uncertainties have made it important for the MPC to consider bottom-up analysis alongside top-down model-based estimates of monetary policy transmission. By doing so we look to judge how restrictive we are with policy. One of the clearest indicators that higher interest rates have weighed on demand has been the rise in the household savings ratio which now stands at just over 10% (although other factors - precautionary motives related to heightened uncertainty or structural factors – could have played some role too).
As set out in the August MPR, several of these bottom-up indicators suggest the impact of past increases in Bank Rate on the level of GDP is now around its peak. For example, survey evidence from the NMG and the DMP show that the numbers of households and firms reporting higher interest rates as a reason for higher saving or constraining capital spending are falling. Nonetheless, the impact of some channels continues to build. For example, 3.4 million mortgage holders expect to see an increase in payments over the next three years, compared to 2.8 million expecting a decrease (Figure 9).
Figure 9: Proportion of owner-occupier mortgages by estimated changes in monthly mortgage costs, from June 2025 to 2028 Q3 (a)
Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P., FCA Product Sales Data and Bank calculations.
(a) There are around 8,908,000 mortgages in the UK. There are 100 squares, each representing 1% of the total current stock of UK mortgages (around 89,080 mortgages), rounded to the nearest 1%. The projection uses the OIS curve as at 31 August 2025 and the latest available data (2025 H1) on the stock of outstanding mortgages. Changes in payments on variable-rate mortgages are calculated using the implied change in the OIS curve, and changes in payment on fixed-rate mortgages are calculated by assuming that mortgagors refinance onto a typical fixed rate implied by the OIS curve at the point that their fixed-rate contract ends. Mortgages with less than £1,000 outstanding are excluded. These data do not include buy-to-let mortgages or mortgages that are off balance sheet of authorised lenders, such as securitised loans or loan books sold to third parties.
It is partly through demand, which in turn feeds through into inflation expectations, that the restrictive stance of monetary policy is expected to lean against remaining persistence. But monetary policy restrictiveness may also plausibly influence inflation expectations directly, by reassuring the strength of the inflation anchor which in turn can move inflation via price or wage setting decisions.
Looking ahead, although the impact of past rises in Bank Rate looks to be around their peak, they will still be weighing on the level of demand and so continue to contribute to the disinflationary process. While the degree of restrictiveness has fallen over the past 18 months as the MPC has reduced Bank Rate, I still judge the current monetary policy stance to be restrictive and so continuing to squeeze persistence from the system.
The inflation and policy outlook
Taken together, what does this mean for my outlook for inflation and so policy?
I do not see evidence that the disinflation process is veering off-track. Instead it remains my central case that the “hump” will prove just a bump in the road. As I set out:
The current “hump” has been driven by external shocks that are not a reflection of domestic inflationary pressures.
With a looser labour market and weaker demand than in the 2022 inflation episode, I continue to see it as unlikely that we will see additional second-round effects.
The underlying disinflationary process from past shocks remains on track. Wage growth has fallen back and I have little reason to believe it will not continue to do so. This should, in turn, pass through to lower services price inflation next year.
Monetary policy continues to contribute to the ongoing disinflationary process. While the degree of restrictiveness has fallen over the past eighteen months, I still judge the monetary policy stance to be restrictive and to be squeezing persistence from the system.
But there are, of course, risks around these conclusions. And I am mindful of the risk of moving to a high inflation track, particularly after four years of above target inflation.
First, it is possible that new shocks will materialise. As my colleague Meagan Greene set out last week, there are reasons to believe we have entered an age of supply shocks ( Greene, 2025 ). We have experienced a series of repeated supply shocks over recent years, and transformational trends such as climate change and geoeconomics mean it is possible (perhaps even probable) that we may see more going forward.
Second, there might have been a structural change in firms’ pricing behaviour so that the “hand-off” from lower wage growth to services price inflation may not occur as we are expecting.
I described earlier how services price inflation has been explicable given wage growth over recent years. But there are some signs that suggest that the pricing behaviour of firms remains consistent with a high inflation regime. The price microdata underlying the CPI show that the net share of services prices (excluding catering and accommodation) increasing each month has not shown any meaningful moderation since 2022 (Figure 10). This might just reflect additional (one-off but repeated) cost shocks. But it might also indicate something about firms’ margins, or their ability and willingness to push through price changes.
Figure 10: Share of price changes (net up/down balance) as a fraction of the underlying bucket (a)
Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.
(a) Chart shows a 12-month rolling average. The latest data points refer to August 2025.
Third, it might take longer for the degree of slack in the economy to squeeze the remaining persistence from the system.
Indeed, as we set out in the August MPR, there remains significant uncertainty over the degree of slack in the economy. Model-based estimates of the output gap based on capacity utilisation and labour market data suggest a margin of slack has opened up. However, the signal from nominal indicators remains consistent with a margin of excess demand (Figure 11).
I place more weight on the capacity utilisation and labour market measures, and so judge that a degree of slack has opened up. However, this disconnect – and in particular its scale - is a reminder of the nominal puzzle that we face. Indeed, it is possible that the degree of slack is smaller; the degree of persistence larger; or the mechanisms between them weaker than we have assumed. In any of these cases, it might take longer for inflation to return sustainably to target.
Figure 11: Model-based estimates of the output gap (a)
Sources: ONS and Bank calculations.
(a) The model is estimated over 2000–2025 Q2 using the two-step estimator from Doz et al (2011) , obtained from running the data through a Kalman filter and smoother once. The first factor of the dynamic factor model is interpreted as a measure of slack. The factor is then mean-variance adjusted to the MPC’s baseline output gap estimate over 2000–2025 Q2. The labour market block is estimated using survey indicators of slack and the vacancy gap. The capacity utilisation block includes a range of surveys of capacity utilisation also used in the left panel of this chart. The nominal block contains measures of pay and underlying inflation. The data are shown to 2025 Q2.
In such a world it may be tempting to wait to see the “whites of disinflation’s eyes” before looking to reduce the restrictiveness of policy further. But managing the upside risks to inflation in this way brings risk in the other direction: holding policy too tight for too long comes with costs to output and employment, which could then pull inflation below target .
More broadly, there are downside risks to demand which could also pull inflation below target further out. I have for some time seen risks to the outlook for consumption given that it is predicated on a substantial decline in the savings rate. Our previous projections of material declines in the savings rate have failed to materialise, possibly signalling a structural change in household savings behaviour. And heightened uncertainty whether for domestic or global reasons might weigh on demand too.
Conclusion
We expect inflation this month to peak at 4%, well above our target. It is too high and it is our job return it to target sustainably.
The good news is that this ""hump"" reflects external shocks, and in the current environment it is unlikely, in my judgement, to lead to additional inflationary pressures. Moreover, I have not seen any evidence yet to suggest that the underlying disinflationary process from past shocks is veering off-track. So far so good.
However, the path ahead is not assured. Indeed we face risks on both sides – that greater persistence means inflation turns out to be sticky not bumpy, and that unexpectedly weak demand causes an unanticipated easing in price pressures. Steering a path that manages both risks is not easy.
With this context, I will be focused on identifying those indicators that give me confidence that the future disinflationary process - in particular the “hand-off” from wages to services price inflation - is remaining on track. Indicators of pricing intentions, from surveys and intelligence from our Agents, will be important here, as will conversations like those I have had in Cardiff today underlining the important part you’re playing in the team trying to understand what’s going on in the economy. Indeed we might think of indicators such as these as signposts that help determine whether we are likely to veer off track. And they will therefore be key in determining when it might be appropriate to remove further restrictiveness.
I would like to thank Nicola Shadbolt for her assistance in drafting these remarks. I would like to thank Emily Fry and Swati Dhingra for their work comparing administered services price inflation in the UK and Euro Area. I would also like to thank Giulia Gardin, Matthew Naylor, Ivan Yotzov, Meghna Shrestha and Andrea Sisko, Rupert de Vincent-Humphreys, Carleton Webb, James Talbot, Martin Seneca and Andrew Bailey for their helpful input and comments. The views expressed here are not necessarily those of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) or the Financial Policy Committee (FPC).
Our short-term inflation forecasts only extend six months, and so we use the May MPR forecast, as we do not have a component-level forecast for the February MPR for July and August. The narrative for the news relative to April, May and June would be the same if we used the February MPR for comparison.

Five ‘C’s for Central Bank Research − speech by Catherine L. Mann
Speech
Introduction
Economic research at central banks plays an important role: for the institutions themselves, the economists employed there, and for the decision-makers. Here are 5 ‘Cs’ of research, relevant to central banks but also other institutions with decision-making responsibility in policy and the marketplace: credibility, currency, communication, careers, and change.
Research is the currency of the economics profession, which fundamentally is about understanding the relationships between households, businesses, and financial firms. Good research lends credibility to the institution through more informed decision-making. For the central bank, credibility is crucial to the functioning of monetary policy, its transmission, and monetary policymakers’ capacity to affect output and inflation. The credibility of the institution also depends on investment in this currency of the profession. Investment in staff’s careers who undertake this research implies they have time, resources and guidance to engage in research that supports the policy objectives of the institution.
Research also changes and evolves – new data and methods support progress in the profession and help me as a policymaker to make judgements based on a range of data sources and models. Knowledge-sharing of research across institutions, enabled by conferences like these, encourages innovation.
Finally, credibility, career, currency, and change come together through various forms of communication of that research, as a key ingredient to research quality and decision-making. The Bank of England’s outlets include, among them, internal poster sessions for work in progress, nearly journal-ready staff working papers , and the new Macro Technical Paper series, intended to document models, analysis and conceptual frameworks that underpin monetary policy preparation. footnote  Other Bank outlets include the ‘bite-sized’ Bank Overground posts, and importantly, Bank Underground , the staff blog which can challenge – or support – views of the Monetary Policy Committee or the orthodoxy of the profession. Alongside Bank publications, our researchers also publish in top-tier peer-reviewed academic journals, as well as presenting both at Bank-organized and at top academic conferences. footnote  And, of course, research at the Bank is often highlighted in policymaker speeches, as I will be doing today.
From data analysis to theoretical modelling, econometric techniques and textual analysis, research at the Bank of England has provided important cross-checks for me – particularly to the baseline forecast that at times could not capture important dynamics such as state-dependencies, non-linearities and asymmetries in economic relationships that underlie the monetary policy transmission mechanism, the importance of the inflation expectations channel, and the dynamics of demand.
This speech will discuss some of the most recent staff research on the UK that informs my policy decision. I will emphasize research on inflation but will also highlight analysis that shows an increasing tension between inflation persistence and weak growth – the trade-off that we currently face in the United Kingdom. I will finish by discussing how this research influences my monetary policy strategy.
Persistent inflation persistence?
In the latest Monetary Policy Report , headline inflation is projected to reach a peak of 3.8% in quarterly space, and to remain above the 2% target until Q2 2027, two years from now. Chart 1 plots the contributions to the more persistently elevated level of projected monthly near-term inflation, over the next six months, which is expected to peak at 4%. The contribution from services price inflation remains high at 2.5 percentage points, and food price inflation contributes an additional 0.5 percentage points.

Notes: Figures in parentheses are CPI basket weights in 2025, which do not sum to 100% due to rounding. Data are shown to June 2025. Component-level Bank staff projections are shown from July to December 2025. The food component is defined as food and non-alcoholic beverages. Fuels and lubricants estimates use Department for Energy Security and Net Zero petrol price data for July 2025 and are then projected based on the sterling oil futures curve.
Inflation has been above target for four years now (excluding three months at 2% or less in 2024). In the baseline forecast it is projected to remain above target for another eight quarters. The most recent research on the expectations-wage-price nexus makes me conclude that inflation persistence is greater than the judgement incorporated in the baseline forecast: persistent inflation persistence is my central case. The remainder of this section will showcase some of the research that supports this conclusion.
Let me begin with inflation expectations. Short and long-term household inflation expectations have been rising – with short-term expectations 0.5 percentage points, and long-term expectations a full percentage point above their historical averages. Can we explain this expectations drift?
Anesti et al. (2025) look at the sensitivity of households’ inflation expectations to their personally experienced inflation rate. This gets at the question of whether households place different weights on certain consumption categories compared to weights used for a representative household in the CPI basket. Authors regress changes in perceived and/or expected inflation on changes in experienced inflation, driven by components of the consumption basket. Chart 2 plots the results for the food (in aqua) and services (in orange) categories – which I identified in Chart 1 as being the largest projected contributors to inflation over the next six months. The authors find that inflation perceptions and expectations are particularly sensitive to experienced food price-driven inflation.

Regression coefficients (percentage points)
Source: Anesti et al. (2025) .
Notes: Regressions estimate the relationship between changes in experienced inflation driven by different components of the basket, and changes in households’ inflation perceptions and expectations (as measured by the Bank of England/Ipsos Inflation Attitudes Survey), controlling for age fixed effects. Aqua diamonds represent regression coefficients of food price-driven inflation, orange diamonds represent coefficients of services price-driven inflation. Shaded areas represent the 90% confidence interval. The regression is estimated over a 2003Q1 – 2022Q1 sample period.
Authors also document asymmetries and non-linearities: (1) inflation expectations change by approximately 1 percentage point more following a rise in food-price inflation than they do following a fall and (2) inflation expectations are significantly more sensitive to larger changes in food price-driven inflation than they are to smaller changes.
Inflation expectations are also an important driver of wage growth. Staff analysis employs a machine learning model based on boosted decision trees following Buckmann et al. (2025) to fit non-linear associations between various indicators and wage growth. This allows to decompose wage growth into its drivers – representing the wage Phillips curve. Chart 3 shows this decomposition. The authors find that the trend wage-growth component – shown in purple – is slow-moving, and remains elevated, contributing around 0.3 percentage points to wage growth above the 3% mean. Trend wage growth in the model is informed by inflation expectations, and this is consistent with wage growth taking longer to return to its target-consistent rate.

Annualized and smoothed
Source: Staff analysis based on Buckmann et al. (2025) .
Notes: Colored bars show the block-wise predictive contributions to 1-month-ahead annualized month-on-month regular private sector pay growth (white line), around its 1993-2019 mean (3%). Model estimated via cross-validation over 1989-2024 sample. Dashed line: realized wage growth, annualized.
Recently, there also is a notable emerging gap between the model prediction (solid white line) and observed wage growth (dashed white line), which suggests a source of excess or unexplained strength in wage growth not captured by the model. We can speculate that this could reflect accumulated institutional changes such as the national living wage, the rise in employer’s national insurance contributions, and wage compression up the ladder. In light of this unexplained strength, we need to be attentive to the potential drivers, and their consequences as possible indicators of persistence.
We can also use survey data as a cross-check to the boosted wage model. Wage expectations from the Decision Maker Panel survey and our Agents lie at around 3.5-4% by the end of this year – remaining above target-consistent rates of wage growth. footnote  Wage-setting has therefore been an important source of elevated inflation, particularly in services, footnote  because labor costs are a large share of firms’ input costs. Ultimately, however, it is firms’ price-setting behavior that determines inflation.
How do firms set prices in the current environment? Yotzov et al. (2025) analyze the responses of firms to aggregate inflation data releases, using high frequency responses of firms from the Decision Maker Panel. The authors find that positive CPI inflation changes have significant effects on firms’ own-price expectations, while the effects of negative CPI inflation changes are smaller and insignificant. They do not find such effects on price expectations in low inflation periods. footnote  This asymmetric price-setting behavior also has been documented using CPI microdata, particularly for services prices ( Brandt et al., 2024 ).
This research highlights that firms expect to raise their prices by more in response to positive news in CPI inflation and in an environment where inflation is already high, relative to negative changes in CPI and a low inflationary environment. Firms’ expectation formation changes in high inflationary environments – this state-dependency is particularly relevant in the current context of the UK’s inflation hump.
In my speech in New Zealand earlier this year ( Mann, 2025 ), I highlighted that the literature has established an attentiveness threshold for such behavioral phenomena. This threshold inflation rate, if exceeded, prompts agents in the economy to become more attentive to inflation. Using US data, the literature puts this threshold at about 4% ( Pfäuti, 2025 ).
Bank researchers have recently estimated the threshold for the UK to be between 3 and 3.6% (Gaffney and Potjagailo, 2025). footnote  Using a threshold VAR, the authors show the risks of just “looking through” the inflation hump. As shown in the left panel of Chart 4 , if inflation is above the identified threshold, the response of inflation to a standardized supply shock in the economy is stronger: one year after a supply shock that raises oil prices by 10%, CPI inflation rises by more than 0.6 percentage points if inflation is already above the threshold as the shock hits (in orange). footnote  The effect is less than half that in a low-inflation environment (in aqua).
Moreover, second-round effects operate via changes in inflation expectations (right panel of Chart 4 ). For example, if expectations are more backward-looking, inflation is more persistent in a high-inflation regime. This research emphasizes that the inflation hump in the forecast, which pushes the inflation rate to 3.8% in 2025 Q3 (and 4% in September), would be sufficient to create the environment in which inflation is more persistent than in the baseline forecast, which would imply inflation above the 2% target for even longer.

It is not just expected future inflation that is affected when inflation pushes above the attentiveness threshold. Historically, as highlighted in my speech on the Great Moderation last year, higher levels of inflation have coincided with higher volatility in inflation ( Mann, 2024b ).
While this is an observation of correlation and not causation, more volatile inflation can induce uncertainty about the future path of inflation, as it becomes more difficult to forecast. This undermines households’ and firms’ capacity to make well-informed financial decisions. Can research help disentangle the inflation rate from uncertainty created through inflation volatility?
Using a UK household survey, Fischer et al. (2025) implement a randomized controlled trial with information treatments that contain inflation forecasts. They find that lower inflation uncertainty leads to higher household planned spending and expected income, while also reducing their uncertainty about future income ( Chart 5 ). Using a follow-up survey, the authors also find that households with the initial treatment of lower inflation uncertainty also saved less, indicating an effect on actual (not just planned) behavior. There may well be symmetry for these effects. Georgarakos et al. (2024) , using euro area data, show that higher uncertainty about inflation (which historically has been associated with higher levels of inflation), reduces households’ subsequent durable goods purchases.

Weak growth ahead?
So far, I have emphasized the increased inflation persistence and other challenges to achieving the inflation target sustainably in the medium term beyond what is incorporated in the baseline projection. If that was the only issue, monetary policy decision-making would be straightforward – higher inflation should be met by a tighter stance. However, an inkling of another problem was revealed by the last research I summarized – high inflation uncertainty leads to lower spending. There are clear interactions between the inflation and growth trade-off that are foreshadowed by the research I have presented so far.
In fact, UK GDP has remained weak with the level just barely above pre-Covid. Growth rates have averaged below 2% since the end of 2022, and are projected to remain subdued throughout the next three years. How does research inform my thinking about prospects for UK economic activity? What ‘under the macro bonnet’ perspectives on GDP growth inform my decision-making?
Staff at the Bank of England use a quantile MIDAS regression approach that both incorporates different types of data and quantifies the likelihood of different GDP outcomes to understand the distribution of risks around the forecast ( Mantoan and Verlander, 2025 ). Due to the multiple shocks hitting the economy, GDP has been increasingly volatile. footnote  Traditional nowcasting models use multiple frequency data inputs but have limited ability to incorporate these shocks and risks. The quantile MIDAS approach can forecast the entire distribution of future GDP outcomes instead of just a single point estimate.
Chart 6 shows four probability distributions of GDP nowcasts between December 2024 and June 2025. These distributions result from a combination of “hard” indicators, such as monthly GDP outturns, and “soft” (survey) data. The latter are available at a higher frequency than GDP, are more forward-looking, and include measures of systemic risk, retail sales data, and various purchasing managers’ indices, among others. The distributions reflect some tension between the strength in GDP outturns (the right mode) and survey steers (pointing to the left mode).

Notes: Methodology using non-parametric distributions based on Mitchell et al. (2024) . One-quarter-ahead probability distributions for quarter-on-quarter GDP growth fitted from Quantile-MIDAS outputs to a non-parametric distribution. Monthly labels refer to the nowcast of the respective quarter of the year that the month falls in. For example, December 2024 represents quarter-on-quarter GDP growth for Q4 2024 based on data until December 2024. This chart was updated on 24 September 2025 to correct for an error in the fitting of distributions.
As Chart 6 shows, these distributions have evolved over time – the GDP forecast turned bimodal in March 2025. Steers from the hard and soft data started to diverge in March, when the hard data pointed towards higher GDP growth than the timelier survey indicators. The modes shifted further apart in May, with both positive and negative growth almost equally likely. The June exercise similarly shows two modes, but both are positive. The GDP quantile MIDAS emphasizes to me that the trade-off between persistent inflation persistence and quite weak GDP growth remains.
Monetary policy strategy
The research shows increased persistence in inflation – which alone has a clear monetary policy response: tight(er) monetary policy. It also shows a weak growth outlook – which on its own also has a clear monetary policy response: loose(er) monetary policy. The combination of the two makes the monetary policymaker’s job harder in both decision-making and communication. Since each objective pulls the monetary policy instrument in a different direction, the key is to communicate clearly: 1) my assessment of the economic outlook and 2) my reaction function, in order to set expectations for the future path of policy, conditional on the outlook.
As I already mentioned in my last speech on the topic of research and policy ( Mann, 2023b ), the key for monetary policy decision-making is how to weight information and predictions from existing models along with innovative new research, to distil a reasonable picture for how inflation and output might evolve under different economic and monetary policy scenarios.
Beginning with my view on the outlook. The risks of, on the one hand, increased inflation persistence, but on the other hand, a weaker domestic outlook, were both explored in the staff’s scenarios published in May. In my assessment, the scenario outlining upside risks to inflation through inflation persistence (which included additional second round effects in domestic price and wage-setting, amplified by weak potential productivity growth) is playing out, whereas the ‘downside risk to demand’ scenario remains a risk and is not my central case. The projected inflation hump is higher than in our forecast in May, and together with elevated food prices and inflation expectations, increases the risk of attention threshold effects.
A well-known result in the literature is that if policymakers are uncertain about the degree of inflation persistence, an aggressive response to inflation is appropriate when policymakers are aiming to avoid bad outcomes ( Söderström, 2002 ) – by squeezing out inflation today, you prevent it from persisting in the future. If this policy is not followed, even tighter policy would be required later to remove the resulting higher inflation and rein in the expectations drift. Similarly, Angeloni et al. (2003) and Coenen (2007) find that with uncertainty about the degree of inflation persistence, it is better, from a robust control perspective, to assume a high(er) degree of persistence.
Chart 7 shows the August 2025 baseline projection for inflation and the output gap (in white), conditioned on the market curve. I compare this to the higher inflation persistence scenario, again conditioned on the market curve (in orange). This is to illustrate how, conditional on a given path for interest rates (in this case, the market curve), a higher inflation persistence scenario that I see as currently playing out, differs from the baseline forecast. footnote  Should this persistence scenario occur, inflation would remain above target throughout the three-year horizon. This implies that monetary policy is not tight enough under the market curve, or that financial market participants do not put much weight on this sort of scenario materializing.

To assess what a more appropriate path for policy might look like, I leave the August baseline forecast behind, given that the economy, in my view, evolves according to the inflation persistence scenario. We can reproduce the inflation persistence scenario with monetary policy following an endogenous path. In Chart 8 , the aqua lines show the inflation, output gap, and Bank Rate outcomes when we no longer condition on the market curve, but policy instead evolves according to a targeting rule which minimises the deviations of inflation from target and output from potential. These policy projections identify the best outcomes – in terms of inflation and the output gap through the lens of a loss function – that monetary policy could achieve in the model, and the policy path that would deliver them. footnote  While the projection is produced on the basis of reasonable assumptions for policymaker preferences over trade-off management and interest-rate smoothing, it should not be interpreted as representing the MPC’s view of the future path for policy, nor explicitly my view either.

As an illustrative policy path, it is a benchmark and shouldn’t be taken at face value as a prediction for the path of Bank Rate. That said, we can see that it suggests a significantly tighter path for policy than is embedded in the market curve. This brings inflation back to target more quickly, at the expense of a larger output gap opening up. For this illustrative combination of inflation-output gap-Bank Rate to hold true, inflation persistence would have to play out exactly as modelled in the scenario along with the weights on trade-off management and interest-rate smoothing. All of those specifics are not tailored exactly to the weight I place as a policymaker on an activist policy stance (and aversion to a ‘policy boogie’ ( Mann, 2023a ) that might involve hiking in the near-term only to pivot to cuts), and on the relative weights on deviations in inflation from target, and output from potential.
What does this exercise reveal that is relevant for my reaction function? I have spoken before about my activist approach to monetary policy. Let me today provide a bit more color on this, using language recently published in the ECB’s latest monetary policy strategy review . Specifically, they distinguish between forceful and persistent monetary policy action. My own view on this distinction is that an activist strategy combines these two aspects. A more persistent hold on Bank Rate is appropriate right now, to maintain the tight (but not tighter) monetary policy stance needed to lean against inflation persistence persisting. However, I stand ready for a forceful policy action, in the form of larger, more rapid Bank Rate cuts, should the downside risks to domestic demand start materializing. An activist policy strategy is needed to clearly communicate about the current and future path for policy, which will enhance the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, particularly in an environment of volatility in inflation and financial

Weathering the storm: stability in a changing climate - speech by Sarah Breeden
Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, shares some real world examples of how risks to price and financial stability from climate change are emerging now, and how they might grow going forward. She emphasises the importance of work at the Bank and in the wider financial sector to build awareness of and resilience to these risks.
Speech
Introduction
I wanted to start by saying what an honour it is to speak this evening at the annual Chapman Barrigan lecture. It is always special to come together to celebrate trailblazing women. And this series is a wonderful tribute to and legacy for Honor Chapman and Trish Barrigan, two outstanding, inspirational, pioneering leaders in property.
The lectures provide space for reflection and discussion on the forces shaping our economies and financial systems and I’m delighted to contribute to that tradition tonight. It’s a time of profound change – technological, geopolitical, environmental. I plan tonight to explore the theme of our changing climate and the role of the Bank of England in delivering stability through that.
I am also greatly honoured to speak to such a distinguished crowd from the commercial property sector. The commercial property sector is undoubtedly a hugely important sector of the United Kingdom’s economy. It provides the physical space for businesses to operate, innovate and generate jobs. It attracts significant amounts of foreign capital as it does so. And it directly employs over 1 million people.
But it is also a sector that has over the years seen significant cycles of boom and bust and contributed to many financial stability challenges, both in the United Kingdom and overseas (including in the US even very recently). Understanding the challenges facing the sector is a critical part of our financial stability mission, and we are hugely grateful to the industry for the open and constructive engagement that you all provide.
Central to that engagement is the Bank’s commercial property forum (CPF). Such engagement has been crucial as recent years have not been quiet. Just in the last five years, the CPF has helped us to navigate the financial stability risks from a global pandemic and the transition to a higher interest rate environment, all against a backdrop of rising global uncertainty.
Today, the sector continues to face headwinds. The latest Bayes UK CRE lending Report shows that almost 70% of all outstanding debt (around £100bn in total) is due for repayment by 2027. Around 10% of debt matured in 2024 with a small minority in default and the rest restructured or extended. Refinancing pressures will likely be felt more acutely in sectors such as office and retail given the post-pandemic shift to more remote working and the continuing shift from physical to online shopping. The transition to higher rates is far from over.
But reassuringly, compared to before the financial crisis, bank lending standards have been much more conservative, and our stress tests show that the UK banking system is resilient to very large falls in CRE prices. Other players matter too, of course. Non-bank participation in the UK CRE sector has grown rapidly since the global financial crisis, adding welcome diversification to the supply of funding. But here I am mindful of vulnerabilities in the non-bank sector – most notably liquidity mismatches, leverage and valuation opacity – and the potential for increased risks that they bring ( FSB, 2025 ).
But I do not wish to focus on those vulnerabilities tonight. Instead, I want to focus on the challenges of a changing climate. That matters for the Bank of England given our statutory responsibilities for monetary and financial stability. And it matters for you too, as the commercial real estate sector has both a key role to play in helping navigate the climate transition and a set of risks to manage as we do so.
These risks from a changing climate are not hypothetical or somewhere far off in the distance.
Last year was the warmest year on record, with annual average global temperatures exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The IPCC estimates that average global temperatures are now more than one degree higher than pre-industrial levels. They are set to rise at 0.2°C per decade, given past and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions footnote  . And as average temperatures rise, so too does the risk of passing through ‘tipping points’ as ice sheets collapse and weather patterns change, causing large, accelerating and potentially irreversible impacts footnote  .
The rise in temperatures has already increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events both abroad and at home. In the UK, intense storm rainfall, like that seen in 2023-24 is now expected to occur once in every five years (compared to once in every 50 under a pre-industrial climate). Under a 2°C pathway, that rises to once in every three years.
The risks posed by this changing climate matter for individual firms’ safety and soundness, the resilience of the financial system as a whole and, through their impact on the macroeconomy, the outlook for inflation.
These are real risks that could materialise, and in some cases already are materialising, within the time horizons that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC) care about. Indeed, when I first started work on climate change at the Bank almost ten years ago, my challenge was to explain how it might be relevant to the core mandate of a central bank. I think the examples. I’ll cover today demonstrate clearly how that case has now been made.
Price stability
Let me begin by looking at how the physical effects of climate change impact inflation, starting with food.
Severe weather events – droughts, floods and extreme temperatures – can significantly impact global agricultural prices. Those events have been occurring with increasing frequency and intensity in recent years.
Historical experience suggests that severe weather events can generate price increases of over 30% in global agricultural commodity prices ( de Winne and Peersman, 2021 ). As an economy that imports a high proportion of its food – around 40% – UK inflation is highly susceptible to such changes. Another study by Peersman (2022) showed that for a 1% unanticipated increase in globally-traded food prices, euro-area headline inflation rose by 0.1%. Our own work at the Bank of England shows broadly comparable results for the UK.
UK food prices are also affected by extreme weather events that take place at home. As we saw in 2023, excessive rainfall can have significant impacts on the supply of domestic agricultural products footnote  . Beyond food production, weather events, such as extreme heat, also disrupt infrastructure, such as transport, that are critical to food supply chains footnote  .
The impact of severe weather events on inflation extends beyond the food sector. A Bank of England study using county-level data for England over the years 1998-2021, shows that flooding impacts output and prices across sectors – including those that feed into core inflation ( Ficarra and Mari, 2025 ). It finds that the impacts differ across sectors, with some presenting as a demand shock and some as a supply shock.
What matters for monetary policy is the impact of such events on aggregate inflation. While most studies find negative impacts on GDP from extreme physical events, the estimated impact on aggregate inflation is less clearcut.
As set out in work by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), severe weather events impact the economy through demand, supply, and financial channels, with the aggregate inflationary impact depending, in theory, on whether the demand or supply effects of the event dominate footnote  . That is uncertain footnote  . But as my colleague James Talbot has highlighted, there is a growing body of literature to suggest that supply effects dominate, meaning these events increasingly represent a trade-off inducing shock for monetary policy makers to deal with ( Talbot, 2025 ).
These impacts are likely to increase over time as temperatures rise further and shocks become more frequent and severe. In a study for the ECB, Kotz et al (2023) show that without adaptation measures, global food price inflation might increase by 1-3pp by 2035, increasing pressures on headline inflation by between 0.3-1.2 pp. They provide evidence that upward pressure from warmer temperatures on inflation is larger in warmer months and warmer countries, suggesting that the effects associated with climate change may be more pronounced as average temperatures rise. More broadly, the emerging literature between climate change and inflation suggests a non-linear relationship ( NGFS, 2024 ). The possible existence of “tipping points” adds to the importance of this work.
In addition to considering these impacts on inflation from the physical effects of climate change, we need also to consider transition effects.
The UK government has for some time been implementing policies to transition to a less carbon-intensive economy, consistent with its commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. By reducing the physical effects of climate change, these actions will likely reduce the trade-offs monetary policy makers face in the long term. But they can have an impact on inflation in the shorter term.
Indeed I first discussed the role of carbon pricing in explaining some of the large rise and fall in inflation over 2021-23 in a speech I gave in January.
At its peak in October 2022, headline inflation reached 11.1% ( ONS, 2022 ), around 40% of which can be attributed directly to rising energy prices, especially gas and electricity. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting disruptions to gas supply – a classic “gas supply shock” – forms the prevailing narrative for the initial rise in inflation ( Alessandri and Gazzani, 2025 ).
But while the invasion was undoubtedly the most significant single driver, carbon prices also rose rapidly during this period. By the summer of 2022, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) carbon price had roughly doubled relative to the previous year (Chart 1), in part reflecting several policy announcements that effectively tightened the (future) supply of carbon allowances in both the UK and EU footnote  . The rise in wholesale gas prices will have also contributed to the increase in carbon prices ( Shin and Mari, 2025 ).
Chart 1: Carbon emissions allowance prices in the United Kingdom
Sources: Bank calculations. Data from LSEG and LSEG Commodities Research.Notes: The chart depicts the daily UK-relevant carbon price i.e. the EU ETS carbon price from 2005-2020, and the UK ETS carbon price from 2021-24. The EU ETS price has been converted from EUR to GBP. The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) UKA forecast (green dots) is in normal terms (adjusted for 2% inflation)
We estimate that around 1 percentage point of both the increase and subsequent fall in headline inflation over the 2021-23 period is likely to have originated from these changes to carbon policy (Chart 2, RHS). That reminds us that changes in carbon policies can have both inflationary and disinflationary impacts. Indeed looking over a longer horizon, changes in carbon policies have both pushed up and down on prices, albeit at much smaller magnitudes than in recent years (Chart 2, LHS).
Chart 2: Historical decomposition of past contribution of carbon policy shocks to developments in UK headline inflation
Source: Bank staff analysis based on Copeland et al (2025) Notes: The figure reports the historical contribution of the identified UK-relevant policy shock to UK headline inflation as estimated by the VAR model in Copeland et al. (2025) . To provide conservative estimates, the left-hand side chart is estimated using a “low carbon price” sample period (June 2008 to December 2020) whereas the right-hand side chart is estimated using the full sample, which includes the “higher carbon price”, period (June 2008 to April 2024).
The energy sector plays an important role in the transmission of carbon policy shocks to inflation (Copeland et al, 2025) . Our estimates suggest that multiple energy-related commodity prices – including carbon allowances, crude oil, and natural gas prices – increase in response to a shock. These rising costs are passed on to the energy prices faced by households and firms. And, via supply chains, energy intensive firms also pass these through to non-energy prices.
The source of an energy price shock matters for monetary policy. We have estimated that a 1pp rise in energy price inflation originating from a shock in the carbon market has a roughly 25% larger impact on headline inflation relative to an equivalent shock arising in the gas market. It is also several months more persistent than if it had originated in the oil market (Chart 3).
Oil and gas prices have historically been, and are likely to remain, the primary drivers of energy prices: it takes an unusually large carbon supply shock to generate a 1pp rise in energy price inflation footnote  . But carbon shocks are likely to grow in frequency and size over coming years, as carbon pricing schemes become more stringent, sectoral coverage widens, and as carbon prices are expected to rise (diamonds on Chart 1). It is however also likely that the drive to decarbonise, particularly in the power sector, will reduce the aggregate impact of carbon price shocks over the longer term.
Chart 3: Impulse response functions of UK headline inflation to carbon allowances, gas and oil supply shocks scaled to increase energy inflation by 1 percentage point at peak
Source: Copeland et al (2025) Notes: Impulse responses to the identified UK-relevant carbon policy shock, and the natural gas and oil supply shocks identified by Alessandri and Gazzani (2025 ) and Känzig (2021) . Responses are normalised to increase energy CPI inflation by 1 percentage point at peak. Estimation sample: June 2008 to April 2024 for the carbon and oil shocks, and to December 2023 for gas shock (owing to the shock series length). Note: our UK-specific reconstruction of Alessandri and Gazzani’s gas shocks (which takes the UK NBP natural gas price change around event days) enables estimation over the full sample, and yields similar results. The solid line represents the median draw. The shaded areas are the 80 percent credible intervals. For comparability across shocks, these are standardised to increase energy price inflation by 1 percentage point (at peak), which is a common scaling choice in the literature for ease of interpretation (see, for example, Känzig (2025) and Ortubai et al (2025) ). It is worth noting, however, that this scaling choice means we are considering a particularly large shock in the carbon market: roughly 15 times bigger than a “typical” (1 standard deviation) shock over the sample period.
Understanding how these physical and transition risks transmit to inflation will be especially important for monetary policy makers.
That’s because, as these examples show, climate shocks have a significant effect on energy and food prices. These items are bought regularly and have particular salience for households, meaning they have outsized effects on inflation expectations ( Bonciani et al, 2024 ) and so potentially wage and price setting behaviour. In addition, in a world where these shocks become larger, more frequent and more persistent, the risks of these second-round effects become even greater.
Indeed, as my colleague James Talbot recently set out ( Talbot, 2025 ), these shocks sound rather similar to the shocks monetary policy makers have faced in recent years – large, unpredictable, but persistent supply shocks in areas of salience for households. So monetary policymakers will need to understand the economic impact of these climate shocks and be ready to react as needed, if we are to keep inflation expectations anchored and inflation low.
With climate change already influencing the economy, a better understanding of how monetary policy might need to respond to climate shocks matters for investors too, including those in CRE. Building our collective understanding of what is happening and the appropriate policy response is not an easy task. But it is one we must rise to.
Financial stability
Climate change also matters for financial stability.
Back in 2022 our Climate Exploratory Scenario explored the financial risks posed by climate change for the largest UK banks and insurers.
The exercise concluded that climate change creates risks to households and businesses globally, and so for the financial system. It showed that if banks and insurers did not respond effectively, climate risks could cause a persistent, material drag on their profitability. Loss projections varied across participant type and climate scenario, but amounted to hundreds of billions of pounds. And losses would be significantly higher in a scenario with a late or disorderly transition and higher still in a scenario with no further policy action and so higher, and still rising, physical risks. Individual firms, and the financial system overall, would be much less resilient.
In that context, I’d like to hone in on two specific examples where climate risks becoming more proximate could directly impact financial stability.
The first relates to a question that I – and other Bank colleagues – have raised of a possible “climate Minsky moment”, where the crystallisation of climate risk triggers broad asset repricing, perhaps similar to the impacts on asset prices we saw during Covid 19 or the start of the war in Ukraine. footnote
The impact on repricing of any ‘trigger climate event’ would of course depend on the source of the shock, how well climate risks are priced before it, the speed of any repricing, and if vulnerabilities in market-based finance further amplify it.
Analysis of these risks has to be global. The UK has already made much progress in its transition to net zero. It has also experienced fewer extreme weather events than other parts of the world. But as a small, open economy with a large financial centre, the UK is exposed to cross-border spillovers in global financial markets, and the global operations of large UK companies and UK-based Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) mean they are of course vulnerable to climate developments overseas.
On pricing, there is evidence that climate risk is starting to be priced in assets such as corporate and sovereign bonds. But our analysis suggests that current prices neither fully account for the transition risks we could see as part of the transition, nor the physical risks we could see in its absence. footnote  In this context, markets over time or in response to a significant climate event begin to place more weight on scenarios where climate risks result in a broad-based macro shock, characterised by inflationary shocks, sharp changes in interest rates, and increased risk premia. And that would of course mean that they re-evaluate upwards their pricing of climate risk today.
The speed of repricing is crucial for understanding financial stability impacts. Rapid repricing could occur if markets start pricing in severe physical climate risks or a disorderly transition, perhaps following acute physical disasters. Even gradual repricing could result in short bouts of rapid price movements.
This repricing could affect a wide range of assets. Scenario analysis undertaken by Bank staff suggests that a portfolio of long-duration G7 sovereign bonds could lose 10-20% of its value given interest rate risk and increasing risk premia (depending on the scenario). footnote  Corporate credit spreads could widen, making the repricing of corporate asset classes even more significant.
Chart 4: Climate re-pricing of a long-duration G7 sovereign bond portfolio
Source: Measuring climate-related financial risks using scenario analysis (Holden et al, 2024)
Large UK NBFIs, which are more exposed to market risks like these than banks, might not be resilient to such a shock. The first-order repricing shock is of a similar size to the shock in last year's SWES. footnote  Larger declines in sovereign bond prices could lead to uncertain behavioural responses by NBFIs, such as forced selling in excess of that observed in that exercise.
These risks, and the tools to assess them, are evolving rapidly. It's important to take them seriously and fully understand the broader impacts, including potential behavioural responses. Following this work, we have a better understanding of how climate risks might impact financial markets. But there is more for us and for market participants to do. And to that end, we are further clarifying our expectations for banks and insurers through our recently published consultation paper .
Let me pause briefly on commercial property since assets here might also be vulnerable to sudden repricing. We are already seeing evidence of a “green premium” being paid for more sustainable office space footnote  . That suggests that some climate risks are already priced in. However, a sharp reassessment of physical risks or the likelihood of a sharp and disorderly transition, may lead properties that are more exposed to severe weather events or that do not live up to sustainability standards to face a heavier discount. So there is work to do here too.
Climate risks becoming more proximate can also impact financial stability through the withdrawal or a higher cost of insurance. As flood risks intensify, insurers may withdraw coverage or increase price. This is already happening in the US, where policy non-renewals correlate with regional climate risks. footnote
Prospective homebuyers in flood prone areas might anticipate reduced insurance availability and higher premia, demanding discounts to house prices to compensate. Our November 2024 Financial Stability Report found that in the most pessimistic climate scenarios, the 1% of properties most exposed to increases in flood risk could lose around 20% of their value. And the potential fall in house prices for the 10% most exposed areas would be, on average, 6.5 times larger than in areas with a median level of risk. footnote
Mortgage lenders’ exposures are sensitive to house prices. A price fall would increase the loss given default on a property. If more properties were uninsured, potential losses faced by lenders in the event of flooding would also increase. We could see mortgage prisoners, where existing mortgage holders are unable to refinance their homes. Our CBES analysis found that in our late and no action scenarios mortgage losses faced by banks are around four times larger than in our early action scenario.
Changing insurance availability can also impact commercial real estate. It is estimated that 10% of commercial properties are in flood plains and the impact of flooding on affected businesses can be severe ( Crampton et al, 2025 ). The need for businesses to self-insure could also put downward pressure on their investment expenditure.
In the UK we have Flood Re for residential properties – a joint reinsurance initiative between the Government and the insurance industry. This limits the short-term financial impact of flooding on households, as around 90% of residential properties are insured. But commercial properties are not covered. And as physical climate-related risks increase over the long term, and the Flood Re scheme ends, financial stability risks could develop. What happens as we approach the end of Flood Re matters a lot.
These examples highlight how some of the risks to the financial system are becoming more proximate. Since the Bank first started its thinking on how climate change matters for the financial system we are in a much better place – managing climate risks is becoming increasingly embedded in our analysis and our actions, and our increased understanding of a host of risks has led us to feel better prepared. However, there is much more for us and market participants to do to minimise both the likelihood of climate risks materialising and their impact if they do.
Conclusion
So where does this leave us? In 2019 I gave a speech titled “Avoiding the storm”. As I have hopefully highlighted for you this evening, the storm, or at least the beginnings of it, is already upon us. And so it is vital for us now to work out how to “weather it”.
What does that mean for the real estate sector? Climate risks are real and tangible, and as they become more imminent, property valuations may change rapidly. Real estate owners and lenders could face significant risks, particularly if insurance protection becomes unavailable.
To manage these risks and support the transition to net zero, investment for adaptation and mitigation is crucial. Under current Government plans, all commercial property will need an EPC rating of B or above by 2030. 83% of commercial buildings in major cities currently fall below that standard footnote  . The cost of transition will be substantial and require significant financing. Without the necessary funding, we risk stranded or “zombie” properties.
As the central bank, our role is to provide the right macroeconomic and financial environment for this investment. That means two things: ensuring price stability and maintaining a strong and resilient financial system. And we need to do that in the face of physical and transition shocks. These are the most important actions we can take to ensure a stable foundation for economic growth. Our doing that will support us all in weathering the storm.

In Ficarra and Mari (2025) , a one standard deviation increase in the number of UK floods was found to reduce regional output by 1% and raise regional inflation by 0.5% at the two-year horizon. However, the aggregate economy-wide impact can differ significantly depending on the sectoral composition and position in the supply chain of the area affected by flooding. Li (2024) applies the same identification approach across countries and finds that flooding has a much larger inflationary effect in developing economies relative to advanced ones, because of the larger supply shock it triggers.

The meaning of reserve currency − remarks by Andrew Bailey
Remarks
It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to make some remarks this afternoon.  This is not just to be able to follow a fascinating and timely lecture, but also because I worked for Andrew Crockett at the Bank of England nearly 40 years ago.  Andrew was inspiring to work for, one of the deepest thinkers about international economic policy and central banking.  He also had a quite incautious side too.  He was a practitioner of one of his favourite phrases – “if you have never missed a plane, you obviously arrive at airports too early”.  Andrew was also the creator of the Financial Stability Forum, and its first chair.
I want to spend my time developing a theme that has run though Maury’s lecture, namely what has been the meaning of the term reserve currency, and what does it mean today.  My conclusion is that it is best to think of the term as one that has evolved with the times, and continues to do so.  Thinking of it as a constant term does not help to understand its meaning.
I will start with the nineteenth century meaning of the term.  The monetary regime was the classical gold standard, and convertibility of domestic currency into gold at a fixed price was the nominal anchor of the system.  The term reserve therefore referred to the gold reserves that were held to enable convertibility and the promise thereof.
The nineteenth century Bank of England spent time managing that reserve balance to create confidence in the promise of convertibility.  Today, our banknotes still carry the words “I promise to pay the bearer on demand, the sum of”.  Nowadays, it means that someone can have another banknote, but under the gold standard it meant much more.  This system did not put as much emphasis on financial stability, with the consequence that when crises occurred (as they did in that time), they were managed with a certain degree of adhocery.  Hence, Walter Bagehot wrote his famous critique of the Bank.
There was rather more to the concept of reserve currency in this period.  Sterling was the premier currency of international trade, built on trade with the British Empire, but extending further over time to the countries of the so-called Sterling Area.  It is one of the questions in central bank Trivial Pursuit to name countries in the Sterling Area.
The collapse of this system between the wars led to the Bretton Woods system coming into existence and its heyday once full convertibility was restored.  This system had the joint dollar-gold anchor in the form of a fixed dollar-gold rate and pegging of the major currencies.  The consequence was a substantial growth of official dollar reserves, and the further emergence thus of the dollar as the reserve currency.
The system therefore had a joint anchor.  Because Bretton Woods solved the so-called Trilemma by restricting capital flows, the threat of countries exhausting reserves was limited, but not sufficiently so to prevent difficult devaluations at times.  Moreover, I tend to think of the Triffin Dilemma as posing the question – what if the bluff of the dollar-gold tie had been called, and what would be the consequence?
From the early 1970s that system broke down.  Countries moved to free float, with periodic attempts at management, and a lifting of restrictions on capital controls.  Alongside this was the emergence of the domestic anchor of monetary policy, usually an inflation target.  The dollar had become the predominant currency of international trade and payments.
The role and nature of reserves had changed.  No longer were they a nineteenth century description of the central bank’s balance sheet and its liquidity under the classical gold standard.  Rather, they became a description of so-called official reserves typically, but not always, held by governments, though often managed by central banks.  Their role was different, reflecting the changes to the solution of the Trilemma.  As foreign exchange intervention to influence exchange rates came to an end, the role of reserves in many countries was to act as a bulwark against pressures from capital flows, as seen in the Asian crisis of the late 1990s.
A few numbers help here.  The stock of FX reserves relative to global GDP increased from 3% to 11% between 1976 and last year.
During that period, foreign currency reserves as a proportion of global reserve assets including gold increased from 50% to 90%, while the dollar’s share of foreign currency reserves declined from 80% to 57%.  I take four points from these figures: the total stock of FX reserves has increased; the share of gold fell; the dollar’s share fell as it moved from being the anchor currency to the largest currency; and the evidence further supports the view that the meaning of the term reserve currency has changed over time.
Today, with domestic monetary anchors, financial stability has become the focus of international co-ordination, the opposite of the gold standard arrangements.  The meaning of reserve currency has changed again as a consequence.  I would point to two important features of today’s system.
First, the concept of reserve currency has a lot more to do with the supply and denomination of safe assets which act as security in the financial system, and are increasingly at the heart of it.  This version of the concept of reserve currency has as much to do with the role of US Treasuries as a safe asset, that is present not just in official reserves but also to provide security and collateral in financial markets.
Second, these arrangements are backed up by the provision of contingent liquidity insurance in the form of central bank swaps and a repo facility.  These arrangements underpin the role and primacy of the reserve currency.
I will end with two points which strike me as unfinished or emerging.  First, at least for the large economies, it could be asked today, what is the point of official reserves?  My view is that today their use is more to do with preserving financial stability in the event of stress.  They may be needed to support financial system liquidity in situations of extreme stress.
My second point, as BIS colleagues have emphasised, is that we need to watch carefully the evolution of payments forms and whether innovation here introduces fragility into what I would call the “money system”.
If, for instance, stablecoins emerge as a new form of money, we have to decide how to ensure the singleness of money and therefore trust in money in this world, and what role the notion of reserve currency should play here.
To finish, thank you Maury for such a stimulating lecture.  You pushed me to think further about the meaning of reserve currency.  The conclusion I draw was that we need to emphasise more its adaptable nature, but thereby be very clear what it means in the world of today and tomorrow.
Thank you.

Getting liquidity where it is needed − speech by Nathanaël Benjamin
Speech
Good afternoon, thank you for the opportunity to speak today.
Last week we published our latest Financial Stability Report, which provides the FPC’s view on the outlook for the UK financial system, in terms of the current conjuncture as well as several structural matters. Today I’d like to take a further step back and talk about some long-term trends that will affect the future funding and liquidity environment, and how we policymakers are thinking about liquidity flows across the financial system as it evolves.
Liquidity flows support the provision of vital services in an evolving landscape
The Bank’s approach to financial stability focusses on the role the financial system plays in providing vital services to households and businesses. footnote  And in particular its ability to do so in both good and bad times, as disruptions to these services have large and persistent economic costs. For this to happen requires liquidity to flow to where it is needed most across the financial system so that financial institutions have the funding they need to operate effectively.
When we think about that, we need to consider how the provision of financial services to the real economy has been changing over time. In particular, we need to take into account the growing importance of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) which now play a more significant role than in the past. NBFIs account for around half of assets in the financial system, both globally and in the UK. footnote  In the UK, market-based finance has accounted for essentially all of the growth in UK corporate credit since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and now accounts for 50% of the stock of corporate lending.
NBFIs play a key role in the provision of a range of financial services to households and businesses, operating both alongside, and in partnership with, banks. They provide services directly, such as financing, insurance, hedging products, and long-term savings. And they also support other direct providers of financial services, for example, by lending to banks in wholesale funding markets. Their activities provide liquidity and depth in the gilt market which serves as the risk-free benchmark for a wide range of sterling-denominated debt, such as corporate bonds. NBFIs also play an important role in the SONIA interest rate swaps market, which is used by banks to hedge their interest rate risk and has a big influence on the pricing of fixed-rate mortgages.
This has brought many positives, including cheaper and more diverse financial services to the real economy. But it has also come with the emergence of new types of risks emanating from the NBFI sector and therefore made it increasingly important to consider the liquidity needs of NBFIs – whereas traditionally the focus has been on the liquidity needs of banks. We also have to consider the resilience of the channels through which NBFIs access that liquidity.
Risks in the financial system have transformed in other ways which pose different liquidity challenges. Derivatives markets allow financial institutions to hedge their risks, thereby indirectly supporting the provision of financial services. Post-GFC efforts to strengthen the role of central clearing and improve bilateral margining practices have been successful at reducing counterparty risk in the trading of derivatives. However, these changes have also increased liquidity risks arising from margin calls in times of stress, and more of this risk now sits with NBFIs – something we have talked about before. footnote
Similarly, repo markets are used by financial institutions, including NBFIs, to manage their day-to-day liquidity and collateral needs, as well as to obtain the funding they need to invest in financial assets, thus supporting the real economy. They allow financial institutions to lend to one another essentially as collateralised loans, reducing counterparty risk. However, repo borrowers are exposed to liquidity risk as they may have to top up the collateral backing their repo loans if the value of that collateral falls sharply in stress. And we’ve talked in the past about how this can be exacerbated by sharp rises in repo haircuts from currently very low – often zero – levels, and the consequences for financing conditions in the real economy. footnote
These long-term structural changes are not new and we have been talking about them for some time. But these different types of risks emerged against a backdrop of abundant liquidity, which dampened them somewhat. This may no longer be the case as the funding and liquidity environment has been changing over recent years. It is important for us now to consider whether liquidity is able to flow to where it is needed for the financial system to support the real economy, both in normal times and in stress. And in doing so we should recognise the more significant role that NBFIs play in providing that support.
The funding and liquidity environment has been changing over recent years
We are moving away from a post-GFC monetary policy stance of very low interest rates and very large central bank balance sheets where central bank reserves are abundant. This is a significant change given the key role central bank reserves play in how liquidity flows through the system, as the safest and most liquid of financial assets and the ultimate means of settlement. footnote
In the UK, the Bank of England’s own balance sheet is shrinking as extraordinary monetary policy measures introduced in response to the GFC and Covid are being unwound. As a result, the overall stock of reserves in the system is decreasing and the way in which these reserves are supplied by the Bank is changing. As set out previously by several of my colleagues, we are transitioning towards a repo-led operating framework where the size of our balance sheet will reflect the liquidity needs of the system. footnote
This transition will require a change in how banks and non-banks manage their liquidity. In December 2023 footnote  , we set out how the change in central bank balance sheets was leading to a number of system-wide trends that were likely to affect bank funding and liquidity. And we have consistently highlighted the need for banks to factor these trends into their liquidity management and planning. For example, the cost and availability of reserves will affect banks’ decisions to hold them versus other high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can also be used to manage their liquidity. footnote
We are now some way through this process. The Bank’s reserves supply has fallen to around £680bn from a peak of nearly £980bn. Asset purchases are being unwound through quantitative tightening (QT) while cheap long-term funding provided through the Bank’s crisis-era TFSME lending scheme is maturing or being repaid early by banks, with the amount outstanding declining from £193bn to £83bn.
The banking system has been adjusting to this change. Despite a shrinking supply of reserves, banks have maintained robust liquidity positions, with aggregate Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCRs) of 153% and 285% for large and smaller banks respectively. footnote  Larger banks in particular have been replacing central bank reserves with gilts in their HQLA. And banks have increased their usage of both our Short-Term Repo (STR) and Indexed Long-Term Repo (ILTR) operations as intended. That has helped smooth through frictions in money markets and ensure that the supply shrinks at a manageable pace.
By adapting to this change, the banking system has been able to continue to support the real economy. Lending growth has picked up. Gross lending to households and businesses was 13% higher in the first five months of this year compared with the same period in 2024, with increases seen across all asset classes. Our most recent Agents’ intelligence suggests that SME financing conditions have improved and are now close to what Agents would assess as “normal”, having been unusually tight for several years. The FPC judges that credit conditions continue to reflect developments in macroeconomic conditions. footnote  Banks have managed this while maintaining robust earnings. They have maintained net interest margins at around historical average levels, and their price-to-book ratios have risen in a way that reflects investor confidence in UK banks’ ability to maintain returns on equity around their cost of equity.
It’s not just banks who are affected. The change in funding and liquidity landscape has knock-on implications for the availability of liquidity for NBFIs as well. Banks play a significant role in the provision of liquidity to them, and banks’ own liquidity position is one factor affecting their willingness to on-lend liquidity to others (in addition to capital and counterparty risk considerations).
A new normal for funding and liquidity
The reduction in central banks’ footprint in the financial system is in many ways a return to normal – even though it may not feel like it for many employees in the financial sector who haven’t known anything else in their careers so far. But it is a new normal, reflecting the lessons learned during and since the GFC about the liquidity needs of banks, and of the system as a whole. It is important to consider how different parts of the financial system will continue to have access to the liquidity they need to support the real economy in this new normal.
The financial crisis revealed serious inadequacies in liquidity risk management practices by banks and other financial institutions. Post-GFC reforms have significantly strengthened micro-prudential regulation and supervision of liquidity risks, and we now have a much greater understanding of the importance of taking a system-wide view of liquidity. The PRA’s liquidity supervision framework now includes rules targeted at the key aspects of a firm’s liquidity risk management including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the Net Stable Funding Ratio and the Overall Liquidity Adequacy Rule. Leverage Ratio requirements have also been introduced as a backstop to the risk-weighted capital framework. These guard against the risk of excessive leverage in normal times that could result from the inherent errors and uncertainties in assigning risk weights, which could exacerbate liquidity strains during a stress. For their part, banks have taken the liquidity risk lessons from the crisis on board and manage their liquidity and leverage in a way that is more prudent than was the case prior to 2008.
As my colleague Vicky Saporta has set out, the Bank of England has also learned lessons in the way it provides liquidity and supplies reserves. footnote  Our operating framework is now accessible to a much wider range of banks and we have introduced new facilities to supply reserves against a broad range of collateral, including contingent facilities that can be activated in stress. These facilities allow the supply of reserves to expand when needed, for example if there is an increase in demand for precautionary liquidity in a stress. We have taken steps to normalise regular usage of our facilities in a way which reduces stigma, emphasising that all of our facilities are ‘open for business’.
And we continue to learn. The experience of March 2023 highlights the importance of the composition of firms’ liquid assets and their ready access to central bank facilities in preparing them to deal with faster, larger liquidity shocks. The PRA intends to identify whether changes to the prudential liquidity framework are warranted to reflect these lessons, with any proposed changes subject to consultation in 2026.
Beyond banks, the 2020 dash-for-cash episode and the System-Wide Exploratory Scenario (SWES) provided valuable insights into how banks and NBFIs behave in a severe market-wide liquidity shock, and how their actions can interact to amplify stress across the financial system. footnote  And we also continue to assess the liquidity risk implications of new forms of digital money.
Accounting for the growing role of market-based finance
So both the normalisation in the monetary policy environment and the shift in the provision of services from banks to non-banks are major trends for the financial sector. And my key point is this: we need to think about them together, not in isolation. The ‘new normal’ for funding and liquidity has to take account of the growing importance of market-based finance. Now more than ever, we need to consider the liquidity demands of NBFIs as well as banks given their significant role in the provision of vital services to households and businesses.
This has changed the nature of liquidity flows through the financial system and the types of liquidity risk we are most concerned about. The funding and liquidity landscape influences business decisions by NBFIs, including the level of leverage in the non-bank sector and the types of risks taken by NBFIs. So we need to think about how to support continued provision of financial services by NBFIs in normal times, in a way that avoids unsustainable risk-taking and leverage, and that supports the financial system’s ability to self-manage increased liquidity demands and self-stabilise in severe but plausible stresses. To ensure the central bank needs to step in only in extreme scenarios, not more often.
Unlike banks, NBFIs are not able to hold central bank reserves. They do not have the power to create money (in the form of commercial deposits). footnote  And they do not have regular access to central bank facilities, reflecting the different role they play in the financial system. This poses a unique challenge in ensuring that liquidity flows to them as well as banks. And it means that banks will continue to play a major role in providing liquidity to them, reflecting banks’ special role in the financial system, including their expertise in maturity transformation and credit risk management.
In sterling markets, one of the most important conduits for liquidity flows between banks and NBFIs is the gilt repo market, as it allows participants to effectively lend against gilts as collateral. What we are talking about here is quite different from the type of leverage that banks provide to the private equity ecosystem, which does not involve gilt repo but rather loans secured against collateral which is illiquid and hard to value – I have talked about those risks before. footnote
With only a few notable exceptions, over the past decade the gilt repo market has remained a liquid and well-functioning market. Far from shrinking in the face of abundant central bank liquidity, as some predicted at the outset of quantitative easing, repo activity as a proportion of banking sector assets has remained broadly in line with pre-GFC levels. This is in part due to the increase in activity in NBFIs, and reflects the unique role of the repo market as a major vehicle through which banks are the main providers of liquidity, and with it leverage, to non-banks.
However, recent experience has shown that despite its size and liquidity in normal times, this crucial market can come under pressure when demands for liquidity, particularly from NBFIs, increase in a stress. In the 2020 dash-for-cash episode, gilt repo market functioning deteriorated sharply as market participants, including UK-based dealer banks, were unable to satisfy increased NBFI demand for liquidity to meet margin calls and redemptions. The LDI crisis also highlighted the difficulty in getting liquidity to flow where it was needed in stress. However, the challenge there was different as LDI funds needed less leverage not more and while pension funds had the incentive to borrow, they lacked the ability to do so in effective or timely ways. footnote  So even in an environment of abundant central bank liquidity, there were impediments to liquidity flowing from, or through, banks to NBFIs in stress. footnote
This is consistent with the findings of the SWES, which showed that despite higher NBFI demand for liquidity in the scenario, most banks had very little, if any, appetite to increase the amount of repo finance they extend to non-banks. footnote  This was largely driven by counterparty credit risk concerns, against the backdrop of often zero haircuts. A deterioration in gilt repo market conditions can amplify forced gilt sales, threatening dysfunction in cash gilt markets. These two markets play a crucial role in the pricing of risk-free assets, which in turn underpins a wide set of other transactions. They help liquidity flow around the system, ultimately funding the provision of vital services to households and businesses. Because of this, dysfunction in these markets has costly implications for the real economy.
That’s why one of our financial stability priorities is to enhance the resilience of liquidity in core markets, including gilt repo. It is natural to expect these markets to be impacted by large shocks, as it is likely that demand for liquidity will increase and participants might become more risk-averse and limit their liquidity provision. But we want to make sure that the structure of these markets, and the incentives participants face, mean that these impacts are manageable and that core markets remain sufficiently resilient so that they do not amplify the initial shock.
In 2023, the PRA completed a thematic review of regulated firms’ liquid fixed income financing (or ‘matched book’ repo) businesses, sharing observations on the lessons learned from the large fluctuations in gilt markets in September and October 2022 and expectations that firms should incorporate these into their risk management practices. footnote
We will soon publish an exploratory discussion paper on potential measures to build gilt repo market resilience, such as greater central clearing of gilt repo and minimum haircuts or margin requirements on non-centrally cleared gilt repo transactions. It will also seek views on a broader range of other potential initiatives. footnote
And we have already enhanced our toolkit to step in through the launch of our Contingent Non-Bank Financial Institution Repo Facility (CNRF). While our preference remains for liquidity to flow via banks from our regular lending facilities to NBFIs, we recognise that in periods of very severe stress, intermediation capacity constraints can prevent banks from lending at sufficient scale to prevent spillover effects resulting in gilt market dysfunction that threatens UK financial stability. In such extraordinary situations, the CNRF provides a means of channelling liquidity directly to financially sound and resilient NBFIs. footnote
Key principles for the new funding and liquidity landscape
Notwithstanding the progress made, we are only part of the way through the journey to this new normal and we will continue to learn and adapt as we go.
Because of the unique role we play as both a central bank and a regulator, we have a number of levers that can affect the overall funding and liquidity landscape. These include: i) our monetary operating framework and the terms on which we provide liquidity to the system, ii) the regulatory framework for banks, including liquidity and leverage ratio policies, and iii) policies relevant to the markets in which banks and NBFIs operate.
In using those levers, it will be important to be clear about what our objectives are, to ensure that the set of policy choices we make across them is coherent. Clearly our overarching goal is to deliver the Bank’s core statutory objectives of monetary and financial stability. But within that overarching goal we can set out three objectives:
First, whatever frameworks we have in place, it is vital to maintain monetary control. As my colleague Vicky has set out, monetary control can be achieved under a range of different operating frameworks, although some frameworks may be more robust than others to unanticipated shifts in the demand for reserves. footnote
Second, individual banks should maintain enough liquid assets, including reserves, to meet their own short-term stressed liquidity needs, taking into account their ability to liquidate these assets either with us or with the market. While this has always been important, management of liquidity risk prior to the GFC proved to be inadequate. Micro-prudential liquidity regulation and banks’ liquidity management practices have since improved substantially. And banks need to continue to adapt to changing liquidity risks, including the possibility of faster liquidity shocks in a digital world as highlighted by the experience of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.
And finally, reflecting what we have learned since 2008 and how the financial system has developed, it is important to supplement these monetary policy and microprudential aims with a macroprudential one. Namely that as well as ensuring that market rates remain close to Bank Rate, and that individual banks can withstand a liquidity stress, we seek to ensure that liquidity can flow around the financial system to get where it is needed most. By that I mean that banks and other financial institutions are appropriately incentivised to lend to one another, including in stress, thereby achieving an effective degree of liquidity recycling across the whole ecosystem. While some impact on liquidity provision in a severe stress is inevitable, we want core liquidity markets to be resilient enough so that they help to absorb rather than amplify the initial stress.
There will be choices in how we use our policy levers to achieve these objectives. For example, the level of reserves banks choose to hold in normal times, and the way in which we supply them, will affect their level of asset encumbrance (i.e. how much of their assets are pledged or otherwise committed to us for use in our repo facilities). But as banks encumber more of their assets with us to obtain reserves through our repo facilities, it is important that they also maintain enough ‘dry powder’ to source additional reserves from us in stress and also consider what collateral they have available to source liquidity from private sector funding markets.
Liquidity getting to where it is needed most
To meet these three objectives, we need to ensure that our decisions on the monetary operating framework and regulatory framework are coherent and tread a middle road as we make these choices. This middle road should ensure sufficient incentives for individual institutions to maintain liquidity insurance themselves and also provide incentives for them to support the liquidity of the system as a whole by lending in financial markets. And we need to ensure that funding markets are liquid and resilient in both normal and stressed times, paying close attention to how our policy choices can affect this resilience. That means ensuring liquidity is cheap enough to allow sufficient market depth in normal times, but without encouraging a build-up of unsustainable leverage in the system which would unravel in a stress.
Primary responsibility for managing liquidity risks lies with financial institutions themselves, and this applies for both banks and NBFIs. When managing their liquidity needs, banks should take into account their ability to use our lending facilities regularly for routine liquidity management, which we encourage and welcome. We want to avoid any stigma around routine usage of these facilities in normal times, so that they can be more effective in stress. NBFIs also need to take a prudent approach to their own liquidity risk management, taking on board lessons from previous periods of market instability such as the 2022 Liability Driven Investment (LDI) episode. footnote
That said, we also want to create a funding and liquidity environment which incentivises banks and NBFIs to participate actively in private sector funding markets, rather than hoarding liquidity excessively. This means that we need to be cognisant of potential distortions to banks’ and NBFIs’ incentives to lend to one another, and their capacity to warehouse risk, in both normal times and in stress. We want to encourage the efficient distribution, or recycling, of liquidity across the financial system and to support the efficiency and depth of intermediation in core private sector funding markets. The resilience of these core markets to stress remains crucial, as they underpin a wide set of transactions that ultimately support the provision of services to households and businesses. It is important that market participants, including NBFIs, maintain their own liquidity resilience so that these markets can self-stabilise in response to most shocks. The less efficiently private sector funding markets distribute liquidity in normal times, the less trained they are to cope with shocks, and therefore the more likely it is that central banks might have to step in.
Situations where central banks have to make extraordinary interventions should be rare. But we cannot eliminate liquidity risk altogether and it will remain the case that some shocks are so severe that intervention will be appropriate given the threat to UK financial stability. What we ultimately care about is how the provision of vital financial services would be affected. So as well as thinking about individual institutions’ liquidity needs, we need to consider how significant a role they play in providing those services as well as the potential for their liquidity stress to spread to other parts of the financial system. Given the growing significance of NBFIs, the CNRF is a valuable addition to our toolkit if we do need to intervene.
We should also be mindful of how the funding and liquidity environment can impact the overall level of leverage in the system and the types of risks taken, which in turn affect the size and likelihood of liquidity shocks emerging in stress. Whilst leverage in the financial system supports the depth of funding markets and growth in the real economy, we want to avoid the build-up of extreme leverage in normal times which can create destabilising fire-sales during periods of high volatility and pose very large risks to the real economy. footnote
Closing remarks
As I have set out in this speech, there are a lot of factors impacting future liquidity conditions for banks and non-banks that we need to consider together in the round. Normalisation in the monetary policy environment affects the overall level of system-wide liquidity, and the calibration of our repo lending facilities determines how banks can access liquidity from us. Banking regulation, including liquidity and leverage ratio policies, affects banks’ demand for holding reserves and other HQLA, their capacity to warehouse risk, and their incentives to distribute excess liquidity to other financial institutions. And there are a range of policy initiatives we can consider to improve the resilience of markets that are core to the distribution of liquidity, such as measures to encourage greater central clearing or minimum repo haircuts.
All of these factors affect the liquidity available to NBFIs, and hence their ability to support the real economy. And given the larger role market-based finance now plays in providing financial services to households and businesses, this is very important. In considering these different factors together, it is helpful to apply a macroprudential lens which considers how liquidity flows around the financial system.
If we get the calibration of incentives right across our monetary operating framework and regulatory frameworks, reserves should be neither scarce nor abundant – just ample. Banks would maintain an appropriate level of reserves for their own liquidity management purposes, taking into account the predictability and reliability of the Bank’s liquidity provision. And outside of periods of exceptional monetary stimulus they would also have incentives not to hoard excess and unneeded liquidity, and would instead redistribute it to the rest of the system where it might be more needed.
Let me end on a practical note. Balancing the principles set out above to achieve the right calibration of incentives requires co-ordination on our part to ensure that policy choices are coherent across our monetary operating framework, our microprudential functions, and our macroprudential functions. Fortunately, the UK’s institutional arrangements are well suited to this since the Monetary Policy Committee, Prudential Regulation Committee, and Financial Policy Committee are all housed under one roof. And that co-ordination is happening. We look forward to thinking through these macro issues in collaboration with the industry, towards a steady state which sets up the financial sector well to support households and businesses in a range of environments.

Unexpected curves − remarks by Alan Taylor
In his panel remarks, Alan Taylor outlines his view on interest rates in the long run. He shows that model-based neutral rates can predict policy rates. He explains why he would prefer the Bank to regularly talk about where interest rates are going.
Speech
Introduction
Why do central banks talk about their decisions in public?
For a long time, monetary policy was decided and implemented behind closed curtains. In my view, there are two reasons why that is not a good idea:
First, we explain our decisions and intentions because we believe that it is conducive to both understanding of and trust in the institutional framework of demand management that many central banks find themselves in. In the United Kingdom, this means the delegation of inflation control from the government to an independent central bank; and then it implies the independence of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee for setting the stance of monetary policy in order to hit its statutory target.
The second reason for explaining decisions and intentions is, broadly speaking, because of a desire to affect expectations of future interest rates—either directly or indirectly by affecting expectations of inflation, output and other aspects of the macroeconomic outlook. This in turn affects all parts of the yield curve, not just the short end, and forms an important channel for the transmission of monetary policy.
In my remarks today I am going to speak mainly about this latter point. The question I address is: How can central banks credibly and usefully communicate with agents in the economy, especially when it comes to where interest rates are likely to settle in the long run?
I’m going to argue that the arc of history bends towards greater transparency and that we, the Bank of England, still have a way to go. We at the Bank, or perhaps more precisely, members of the Monetary Policy Committee, are already very transparent along many dimensions. We publish minutes, conditional forecasts, scenario analysis, and other material that underpins our decisions. And we follow a one-member-one-vote strategy, such that disagreement on the committee is made public, and members frequently give speeches in which they explain their individual view of the world in real time.
And my individual view on this question (and not necessarily the view of the other members of the MPC) is that there is one key dimension along which we could be more transparent. And further I will argue that I think we should be. That is, with regard to the future path of interest rates and where interest rates are likely to settle in the long run. footnote
A brief history of central bank communications
Let me first go through a bit of history.
It might sound surprising now, but one can ‘do’ monetary policy without much communication at all. The current regime of central banks speaking in public about their intentions and explaining their decisions is a relatively recent invention. I would like to point to speeches given by two of my predecessors on the Monetary Policy Committee, Andy Haldane (2017) and Jan Vlieghe (2019) , which already contain detailed accounts of the history of central bank communications. I am not going to go through all of it again but will note that, for a long time, central bankers did not think it worthwhile even to announce decisions or intentions to the public, much less explain them or entertain questions. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), for example, did not publicly commit to a numerical inflation target until 2012 and did not introduce press conferences until 2011.
Indeed, central bankers believed that opacity and ‘mystique’ were beneficial to the workings of monetary policy. If they were speaking publicly at all, their communications were not designed to be helpful for understanding how decisions were being made. Without wanting to single out one person, Alan Greenspan’s aphorism, “if I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said”, reflects a commonly held view of what it meant to be a central banker.
Since then, however, this view has made way for the idea that, in fact, monetary policy works best when it is well understood, and not only by insiders but by the general public, too. Part of this change, I would argue, was due to genuine scientific progress that emphasised the role of expectations in the decision-making of economic agents. footnote  But the issue of expectations management really became pertinent only in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) when short-term rates fell to near-zero (or sometimes even below).
It was in this extraordinary environment that central banks really discovered communications for the purpose of changing the stance of monetary policy—this marked the arrival of forward guidance. Even quantitative easing, the purchasing of government bonds and other financial assets from the private sector, beyond portfolio rebalancing effects, can also be understood as a way to deliver forward guidance by other means. In this view, by making policy reversal especially costly, QE reinforces the central bank’s commitment to low nominal short rates for an extended period of time. This would then weigh on bond yields and raise other asset prices in the economy through an ‘expectations channel’ ( Vlieghe, 2018 ) that is separate from a more mechanical asset price channel that works via arbitrage and transmits an increased scarcity of bonds along the maturity spectrum. footnote
Communicating about the end point
However, I don’t intend this speech to focus narrowly, or at all, on forward guidance as it has been envisioned in the post-GFC era. Forward guidance is an unconventional monetary policy tool deployed when short-term interest rates cannot fall but interest rates further out might still have room. In such a world, forward guidance is still intended to affect the stance of monetary policy at business-cycle frequencies in order to provide the right amount of stimulus at the effective lower bound.
Instead, I want to advance the argument that there is value for central banks in communicating policymakers’ beliefs about the neutral interest rate whether it be some collective view or that of any individual member. This is not the same as forward guidance the way I’ve defined it because it is not intended to affect the stance of monetary policy. footnote  Instead, it is about giving an anchor to the end point, the neutral rate—the place where interest rates would come to rest after all shocks, real and nominal, have washed out. In the simplest Wicksellian formulation this is the real natural rate r* plus the inflation target. footnote
Of course, that place is never reached—shocks happen—but just like any other possibly time-varying parameter in our reaction function, it is something we should strive to convey to make that reaction function ever more clear to the outside world. Why? The neutral rate is, by definition, the intercept in our reaction function, the level reached when all other disturbances have reverted to zero. If in communicating our reaction function we think it is important to explain the slope parameters in that function, I would argue it is at least, if not more, important to also communicate the intercept parameter.
In this sense, communicating about the end point should not be understood as a promise or a commitment of any kind. And this non-commitment should be easily and clearly conveyed. For example, it seems to me to be well understood by the outside world that the Fed’s dots, and in particular the long-run dots, are not a promise.
Rather I think communicating about the end point is about revealing beliefs to the public that we all already hold anyway, at least implicitly, and which enter into our collective reaction function. What do I mean by implicit? For example, take our standard forecast for inflation and the output gap. To produce that forecast, a policy rule in a dynamic model maps the level of rates minus neutral into restrictiveness. If one adopts that forecast, one is implicitly adopting its choice of neutral. Of course, any given individual may not agree with that parameter, nor many other parameters, but this is just to say we can’t avoid the presence of neutral and the role it plays. We can only decide whether to employ it in this kind of implicit way, where the parameter is embedded deep inside a model or be very explicit and transparent about discussing it, the route that I personally favour.
Naturally, since neutral is an unobservable, talking about neutral is to express a belief.  And, as with most of our other communications, these beliefs can be wrong. I would argue, in fact, that they are ex post almost certainly going to be wrong most of the time. I have said before that, just as in cricket you expect to get out sooner or later, so in monetary policy you should expect to make an incorrect prediction. That should not mean that we stay in the pavilion, or only venture out in defensive mode. We should share our beliefs and be scrutinised for them, a test that we should be able to face.
However, this raises another question. Even if we were to talk about neutral, would we actually have anything useful to say? As I just said, all forecasts have an error, but the empirical question is how big? And relative to what alternative? Would we add any information, and on the margin would the signal outweigh the noise?
Our expressed beliefs can only be as credible as the method that underpins them. What methods are available? I will highlight three approaches in use.
One method is analysing (using models and data to gather evidence); another is the method of outsourcing (for example, looking at the market curve or survey expectations to gauge other people’s assessment of neutral). Or there is the method of feeling our way to neutral (a view that we will know neutral when we see it).
An objection to feeling our way, by trial and error, or by hiking or cutting until something breaks, is that the ensuing mistakes from under or overshooting, or from instability or other risks, could be costly. Put another way, you will only get feedback on having missed neutral once transmission is completed, which is always with a lag, and when you find yourself with a deviation from the desired target.
An objection to outsourcing to the market is that the market can also be wrong. Often. It can spend the better part of a decade being wrong, as we saw in the 2010s. Chart 1 shows the evolution of short-term interest rates in the UK and the US over the past 20 years alongside their respective market curves.

We see how it took several years for financial markets to realise that short rates would stay low, ostensibly because  had fallen in the wake of the financial crisis. Yield curves were unusually steep during that time even as central banks around the world deployed unconventional tools like forward guidance and QE to flatten them.
It is ironic that when markets were finally convinced of lower-for-longer in the UK, it was on the eve of the largest inflationary shock in a generation which caused central banks to raise rates rapidly in response. It may also be ironic that given all these misses, we at the Bank continue to rely on the market curve as a basis for our forecast.
In my view, however, the recent unanticipated rise in rates was mostly due to the unusual combination of shocks and their severity, and not because the drivers behind the lower neutral rate suddenly went away. All of the structural issues of the post-GFC period—ageing societies, low productivity growth, and a global hunger for safe assets—are still around. Neutral rates remain under long-term secular pressures, but that is a much larger topic beyond the scope of this panel and one that I will discuss another day.
The point for today’s discussion is that the link between these slow-moving structural drivers and neutral rates is not directly observable, so one needs models that embed at least some of these mechanisms. Thus, my preference is for the first option, above, the use of analysis.
Now, a frequently stated objection to model-based end point communications is that the models that we have of neutral interest rates are simply too imprecise, and not good enough to be a guide in real time. That they are, if at all, useful for ex-post analysis of how we got here, not where we’re going and that, therefore, we must resort to other methods.
Let me gently push back on that idea. In the note which will be published alongside these remarks, I show, together with Bank of England co-authors, how model-based estimates of neutral interest rates have actually been better at predicting future short rates than the bond market on average over recent decades. We carefully design an out-of-sample forecasting experiment in which we simulate the information set of a forecaster tasked with predicting the path of future policy rates given only a model-based measure of nominal neutral.
Our setup is deliberately simple. One could of course do a great specification search but that will entail the risk of over-fitting the past and thereby worsening the true out-of-sample performance of the exercise. Instead, we take the model’s equilibrium real rate  and its inflation trend  and recursively estimate a time-varying intercept. footnote  We find that this intercept is important to capture the time-varying term premium that is likely embedded in our estimate of the neutral rate which is taken from a macro-finance term structure model using unadjusted government bond yields ( Davis et al., 2024 ).
We then compare the predictions of that forecaster’s analysis method with the bond market’s implied instantaneous forward at the three-year horizon, that is, the outsourcing method. But we can go even simpler. A possible rule-of-thumb forecast of future policy rates using these trends is simply , fixing the term premium exogenously. We can even obtain a surprisingly competitive forecast for much of the past decades just using this simple fixed-parameter model. And this finding holds both in the United Kingdom and the United States.
To give a brief sense of these results, let me overlay the predictions from the experiment of Bank Rate three years out ( Chart 2 ). The aqua line shows the proper recursive out-of-sample forecast, the orange line the rule-of-thumb forecast with fixed parameters. We see that, because the underlying measure of neutral depends on the entire term structure of bond yields and both nominal and real macroeconomic trends, it is able to react to turning points while still retaining smoothness.

Notes: The charts show the recursive predictions of the policy rate in three years’ time using the one-sided nominal neutral rate following Davis et al. (2024) as well as the respective rule-of-thumb fixed parameter forecasts. Latest observation: May 2025.
The main evaluation of this exercise is shown in Chart 3 . It uses the fluctuation test of Giacomini & Rossi (2010) to show for both countries a measure of out-performance of the model-based forecast of short rates three years ahead (which is why the chart ends in 2022). The test is relative to the instantaneous market forward at that horizon. When the colourful lines are above zero, this means that the model-based neutral rate was a better predictor of future interest rates than the outsourcing solution. Over the past decades, this has been the case more often than not. footnote
I hope this will assuage some of the fears that model-based estimates of  are fundamentally deficient or too imprecise to be a guide in real time. They are no worse than the bond market and often better at predicting future short rates. The point is that we often seem relaxed about using the forward curve to infer the end point or in constructs such as the real rate gap, but the curve on its own seems to have less information than the  models.

Latest observation: May 2025.
To sum up, even if wrong some of the time, the models are often less wrong than the market, and thus they add value.
For that reason, I would argue that model-based estimates of the neutral rate in the economy can be useful for coordinating actions and plans of economic agents in the economy in line with a common baseline. In my personal view, the key is to publish these neutral rates regularly, consistently, and transparently in our Monetary Policy Statements.
But then, how? In reality, end-point communication can take many forms, but the most famous implementation is probably the Fed’s long-run dot plot.
Neither the distribution of long-run dots, nor a swathe, nor some trimmed ‘central tendency’, as has recently been put forward, footnote  yield a perfect measure of the neutral nominal rate. But they all allow the public to gain at least some inference about what FOMC members think. It also allows inference about the FOMC’s assessment of the stance of monetary policy today, say, by taking the difference between the median dot and the current Fed Funds Rate.
I think it can be hugely valuable to have a well understood tool for communicating the degree of stimulus or restrictiveness, especially in times of large and persistent shocks like the ones we have today. And without a view of the neutral rate, one cannot really have a view of restrictiveness. When we measure restrictiveness or stance, as, say, policy rate minus neutral, research shows that stance matters not only for monetary policy objectives but also for financial stability objectives ( Grimm et al., 2023 ).
Historically, the Monetary Policy Committee has used a different and more round-about approach to communicating stance: the forecast. By taking the market curve for interest rates as given and producing a conditional projection of output and inflation, the forecast let agents in the economy infer whether the MPC as a whole believed the market path to be too tight or too loose in order to hit the inflation target sustainably in the medium term. Because the forecast was produced in a way to reflect the so-called ‘best collective judgement’ of the committee, it was itself a communications device.
But this is a very non-transparent and circuitous way of communicating, bound to be less effective than saying outright what we may consider to be neutral. And, in any case, the role of the forecast in the MPC’s communications offering is about to change fundamentally.
As Governor Bailey and Deputy Governor Lombardelli have said in recent speeches, we are moving away from the forecast as the whole MPC’s ‘best collective judgement’ and towards one that a majority agrees is reasonable. footnote  I would welcome if, as part of this journey, we will de-emphasize the central projection in our deliberations and our communications where the forecast production can be more staff led.  I have long thought that a macroeconomic forecast is best when it is allowed to be just that, a macroeconomic forecast and not a policy tool itself.
Conclusion
Finally, this of course raises the question of what comes after. If the forecast becomes more of an input and ceases to be the primary communications tool for the MPC, but the MPC still desires to communicate about its intended or expected path for policy, or wants to provide an anchor for longer-term interest rate expectations, it will need to be replaced by something else to fill the gap.
I believe the MPC would be well-served by finding a vehicle for communicating its beliefs about future interest rates. This need not be a single preferred policy path as it is for the Riksbank . In our one-member-one-vote framework this might neither be appropriate nor feasible. It need not even be a Fed-style dot plot where each member produces a path. There are many potential ways to convey the estimates of the long-run neutral rate as judged by the various members.
Again, the key would be to do it regularly, consistently, and transparently. And in the interest of consistency and transparency I want to leave you with an update of my illustrative rate paths, including end points, which I showed in my first speech as a member of the MPC ( Chart 4 ). I note that compared to the cases I laid out in January, the actual Bank Rate profile in the year to date has been consistent with the path for what we then termed Case 2.
Chart 4: Illustrative paths for Bank Rate
Percent
Notes: These illustrative paths for Bank Rate, from Taylor (2025) , are my interpretation of the three cases used by the MPC, as set out in Box A of the November 2024 MPR .
More interesting at this juncture, is where I think we are now on the path and where we are likely to go next.
In May I voted to cut Bank Rate by 50 basis points, and in June I voted to reduce it further by another 25 basis points. On both occasions, the majority of the committee preferred a shallower path of interest rate cuts. But after some shocks and noise clouded my view of the economy and global developments in the first quarter, my reading of the deteriorating outlook suggested to me that we needed to be on a lower rate path, needing five cuts in 2025 rather than the market-implied quarterly pace of four.
Previously, I had seen a UK soft landing in the cards, with some remaining upside risks to inflation from the bump in 2025. Now I see that soft landing as being at risk, and greater probability of a downside scenario in 2026 pushing us off track, as demand weakness and trade disruptions build. Shocks from energy prices remain a big unknown, but they are not the only factor in play, and aside from domestic administered prices and taxes which fade out in the new year, the underlying demand-supply balance is quickly shifting as slack opens up.
Beyond that, and using the model I described above, I estimate the UK neutral real rate to be about 0.75 to 1 percent, putting the neutral nominal rate at around 2.75 to 3 percent, which sits somewhere above the euro area’s neutral rate and close to the United States’ neutral rate.
Getting there, under our baseline scenario without further shocks, would take more time and a continued removal of restrictiveness in 2026 and 2027 as the economy returns to long-run real and nominal equilibrium.
However, as always, a lot can happen between now and then.

Central Banking in extreme adversity - speech by Andrew Bailey
Speech
Governor Pyshnyy, when you invited me to speak today, I was in no doubt that I was going to be here in person. The UK and Ukraine share unbreakable bonds, which were recognised in the 100 Year Partnership signed in January. That Partnership cements our long-term friendship and lays the foundations for even greater collaboration in areas like science and technology, defence and energy – to go alongside the existing co-operation we have as central banks. As our Prime Minister said when he signed the Partnership, we are closer than ever. But more than that, I am quite simply in awe of what Ukraine confronts as a nation, what you face as a central bank, and how you have conducted yourselves during these most difficult of times.
Of course, it is now accepted good practice that we should all prepare for extreme events, and develop contingency plans to respond to a range of possible scenarios. But our contingency events don’t begin to compare with what you have to deal with on a daily basis. To illustrate this point, we have learned from what you do when it comes to serious disruptions to payments systems and to everyday banking business.
Even though I have been determined to be here today, I can’t claim – with all humility – to appreciate properly your experience. We must give you all the help we can, and by doing so give a very clear message that our support is unconditional.
Before I joined the Bank of England forty years ago, I was an economic historian. History does matter – you know this painfully well. I don’t subscribe to any simplistic view that history repeats itself, but I do believe that there are strands running through history. Long history has shaped your nation. The word nation is critical because the central question is do we share your belief in Ukraine’s right to determine its own future. The answer must be yes.
It is also critical to a central bank in your position. Why is that? Modern central banking is built on the independence of the institution. This is critical to our ability to fulfil our objectives. But, we must be clear what this independence means, and what it doesn’t mean. We are independent from governments under terms set out in legislation. However we are not independent of our people, the people we serve. Our independence is granted by their representatives in parliaments.
And, our independence extends as far, but not further than, the objectives that we are given by Parliament. Central banks are therefore an emanation of the nation state, and through that the people we serve.
We are responsible and accountable for our objectives. Our legitimacy and authority depend on our accountability. This is the essence of modern central banking. There are typically two objectives of modern central banking – monetary and financial stability. I am going to spend most of the rest of my time setting out how we need to think of them together. But, before I do that, I want to make another important point about our frameworks, which relates to their ability to manage shocks.
These are the real tests of our policy frameworks in respect of monetary and financial stability. It’s one thing to develop frameworks in relatively calmer times, but to persist they must be able to stand up and deliver in the face of big adverse shocks.
This has not always been the case in the past. Let me give one example, in the area of monetary policy. The classical Gold Standard emerged to prominence during the nineteenth century. It existed before then, albeit without the same prominence. The nineteenth century was not without economic shocks, but the Gold Standard of the day provided a system in which those shocks could be handled – not always with ease, but still it survived the tests. However, it could not survive the much larger shocks of the period between the two world wars.
In modern times we have combined floating exchange rates and free cross-border capital movements with independent monetary policy oriented towards the domestic objective of price stability. Central to achieving this objective are two things – the independence of the central bank, and a so-called nominal anchor, usually an inflation target which seeks to stabilise the real value of money. We regard this, rightly, as the best way to support activity in our economies. Let me borrow from your web pages: “We care about the welfare of Ukraine and Ukrainians by ensuring price and financial stability as a guarantee of sustainable economic growth”.
The real test of these regimes is how well they have stood up to recent shocks. And, do they provide us with a suitable and helpful combination of the rigour of a nominal anchor – the inflation target – with some appropriate flexibility in how we respond to shocks without compromising the anchor? I think the answer is an encouraging yes.
We cannot prevent these shocks from happening – the causes are well outside our control. But we can prevent the inflationary consequences becoming embedded in our economies, and do so without causing consequences which undermine the legitimacy of our framework – avoiding the problem of the classical Gold Standard in the inter-war period. With the important qualification that the job is not, and is never, done, I think we can argue that a focus on domestic price stability and a nominal anchor has proved its worth.
Moreover, the task is both to respond to the shock itself when it hits, and then to the consequences of the shock, which can be quite different. This is where appropriate flexibility and strong transparency and accountability are critical.
Your experience has been extreme in so many respects, including this one. In the face of full scale war you have had to adapt a combination of interest rate and exchange rate policy instruments, FX restrictions and other tools as necessary. But, you have been very clear in public that after the security risks abate and appropriate macroeconomic conditions are established in place, you will return to conventional inflation targeting.
The message is clear. But more than that, and here the comparison with the Gold Standard is relevant, the commitment to get back to the established regime strikes me as both credible and critical.
To conclude, then, we can now start to assess whether the modern orthodoxy of domestic price stability with a nominal anchor in the form of an inflation target is robust in the sense that it can handle severe economic shocks. This is the critical test. And, I think we can be positive here, always accepting that the job is never done.
Let me move on to my second theme. What are we learning about how our two objectives – monetary and financial stability - fit together?
One of the most pleasurable parts of my job is travelling around the UK on a regular basis visiting businesses and hearing about their experiences. When I do this, I try also to visit schools, and speak to students and answer their questions. I usually say a few words at the start to summarise and describe what we do. My opening line is that as the central bank “we are in the money business”.
It sometimes gets a smile. Monetary policy, as I have described, is about the real value of money, about price stability and low and stable inflation. It’s about confidence in the future of money, the value of money in real terms. Financial stability is about ensuring the future nominal value of money.
Put simply, it is about confidence that the unit of money in one bank account is the same as the one in another bank account at another bank, and likewise that they will be equal to and freely exchangeable with a unit of central bank money, say a banknote. I call this the singleness of money.
It is to ensure this singleness that we pursue financial stability, and in doing so that we regulate banks. And it is why, in my view, these activities have to be in the responsibility of central banks. Unless we pursue and achieve both our monetary and financial stability objectives, we are not fulfilling our role of ensuring the stability of the money system – that’s what it means to be in the money business.
It also follows in my view that there is not a hierarchy of our two objectives – one is not more important than the other. Rather, neither can be achieved satisfactorily without the other also being achieved. I can understand how it can seem odd to have to make this point, but to this day I sometimes hear it argued that there is, or ought to be, a hierarchy.
Two important points also need to be made here. The first is that by no means all of the financial system comprises money. Moreover, the share of the non-money system in the total has grown of late. The second point is that there can be evolution in the precise form that money takes. I will consider these two points in turn.
In order to understand the boundaries of money, it helps to define it. I will do this in two, very traditional, ways. The first is the uses of money. There are three: as a unit of account; as a store of value; and as means of exchange. The second definition is about forms of money. We tend to think of two forms of money: money in the accounts of commercial banks – bank deposits; and money in the accounts of central banks – banknotes and reserve accounts held by banks. Central bank money is also often referred to as fiat money, in the sense that it has the full backing of the state. This is another reflection of the subtlety of the meaning of central bank independence as I described it earlier. It is to the sum of commercial and central bank money that the notion of singleness applies, and it is thus to this sum that ensuring the nominal value is preserved applies.
This said, when we look at the total financial system at present, by most accounts over half of it is not money, in the sense that it is held outside the banking system. We have adopted the term non-bank financial institutions to describe these institutions, or NBFIs for short. I tend to think of NBFIs as the world of investment. It is not a perfect distinction I admit. But the key difference is that when you invest in a non-bank, you do so on the basis that the nominal value of your investment is not assured. This is important, because to grow the economy requires risk taking via investment, quite a bit of which would not be compatible with the assurance of the nominal value of money.
Moreover, a key lesson of the global financial crisis was that banks needed to maintain higher standards of capital and liquidity in order to provide that assurance of nominal value. And it follows from that change to the standards of protection of money in banks, that the non-bank world expanded as some investment assets moved out of banks.
But there are at least three areas of potential difficulty in this arrangement on which we must be focused. The first concerns ambiguity. We have to be on the alert for the development of financial structures which are vague as to whether they are, or are not, inside the money system. In the run-up to the financial crisis, banks created so-called off-balance sheet vehicles which were assumed to be outside the money system.
But when problems hit, they found that investors in these vehicles assumed they were inside the bank, and the bank’s own reputation came to depend on them being so. Problems ensued.
The second area of difficulty concerns risks which can originate outside the banking system but then spread into it. Banks and non-banks are often closely interconnected – for instance in financial markets. As the non-bank system grows, so do these connections. This is why we are spending so much more time now assessing the risks that can arise from non-banks. It is one thing to distinguish banks and non-banks in functional terms, but that does not mean they are insulated from each other, far from it.
The third area of difficulty concerns a challenge that does arise nowadays, namely whether we have over-protected the banking system via excessive regulation, and in so doing pushed more risk into non-banks which would be more safely housed in banks. Put another way, have we increased overall financial stability risk by raising the bar too high in banks? It’s a fair enough question, but intrinsically hard to answer.
I think the best way to approach this question remains to ask what it takes to preserve the singleness of money, because this is the heart of our concern with financial stability. And the answer is that we have rightly raised regulatory standards for banks in the light of a financial crisis, the effects of which continue to be felt almost 15 years on.
I will end with a few thoughts on the other issue I raised earlier, evolution in the forms of money, and what this implies. Mention of this point is often followed either by the word crypto or by the term digital money. I am not going to do justice to what is a very big issue, but a few points are salient here.
First, a few words on crypto. I see crypto as taking two forms: unbacked assets of the Bitcoin sort, and backed assets of the Stablecoin sort. I think it helps to see these two as distinct. Why? The Bitcoin sort does not have the characteristics of money – critically, it does not purport to maintain nominal value, and thus fails the test of the singleness of money. Instead, it is an investment asset, with no real asset backing, and volatile in price.
It’s a risky investment class and should be seen as such. The buyer should beware – so-called caveat emptor applies. Stablecoins are different because they purport to have the characteristics of money and to be usable as such. There is nothing wrong with this, but to pass the test they must provide assurance of nominal value and pass the test of singleness of money. That is perfectly possible to achieve, though I would observe that many of the current versions do not quite achieve that test, not yet at least. In my view we should focus our attention on standards for stablecoins which ensure they do pass the test.
My second thought in the area of the evolution of forms of money concerns so-called digital currency.
What do we mean by this term? After all, money – in the form of central bank reserves – has been digital in form for many years. I think we mean, how do we get the benefits of new digital technologies in the area of payments – where money is a medium of exchange? For instance, how do we get the benefits of smart contracts in payments, and the benefits of using digital technology to fight fraud? I start with the presumption that there should be benefit here – it seems like a failure of imagination if we think otherwise. That said, I remain to be convinced that we need to create new forms of money – such as Central Bank Retail Digital Currency – to achieve this.
By the way, the word retail is important here – we are well on the way to having wholesale central bank digital money, but that is just a natural step on from the wholesale electronic money that we have had for thirty years in our case.
This brings me to my third and final thought in this area. Most payments these days are made in commercial bank money. That’s natural – it’s the form that all our bank accounts take, and we want to make payments straight from our accounts. Logically, then, if there are real benefits to digital technology in payments, we should want to see them in commercial bank money. The buzzword here is tokenised deposits – a bit of a mouthful, but really it is the application of digital technology to the form of money that we have today. The challenge is to apply this to both domestic and cross-border and cross-border currency payments. To be clear, I am not against stablecoins, but they do have to meet the test of singleness of money. I am not against Central Bank Retail Digital Currency, but I question why it is needed if innovation proceeds as I think it should.
That said, you may detect from what I have said that I do think commercial banks need to step up to the challenge of digital money provision.
Conclusion
To conclude, we are living in a world of much larger economic shocks which have their origins outside economic causes. But, what the rest of us are experiencing is minor compared to the tragedy caused by the illegal invasion of your country. Our independence as central banks is grounded in the nation state and the people we serve. This makes it of critical importance that you can exercise your right to determine your future as a nation. I have set out what I regard as important issues for central banks and their twin objectives of monetary and financial stability.
I wish you every success in addressing these issues as a free, strong and independent Ukraine. And I look forward to a future of strong friendship and collaboration between the NBU and Bank of England, as well as between Ukraine and the UK. Never have we been closer, and we must remain that way.
Thank you.
I would like to thank Karen Jude and Rhys Phillips for their help in the preparation of these remarks. I am grateful to the staff of the British Embassy Kyiv and FCDO colleagues for their help in making my visit possible.

Quantitative tightening and monetary policy stance − speech by Catherine L. Mann
Speech
Introduction
Central banks in advanced economies are addressing three tasks at once: (1) The pace and potential end point of the rate cutting cycle, (2) the extent and strategy of normalization of the balance sheet, and (3) the implementation of new institutional designs of reserves management and policy rate control. Across countries, as appropriate for their domestic situation, central banks are moving at different speeds on (1) and (2) and are implementing different arrangements for (2) and (3).
I have discussed (1) in several recent speeches. footnote  Today I will focus on how (2) and (3) – the normalization of the balance sheet and institutional design being implemented at the Bank of England – impact my monetary policy decision-making. That is, how these might interact with (1).
I will start with a review of the monetary policy perspective on the central bank balance sheet. Then I will outline the new approach being undertaken by the Bank of England, and finally, I will pose some questions on how the new institutional design and transitioning to it might affect monetary policy making. By posing questions I hope to encourage further research to inform the policy-making process and outcomes.
A monetary policy perspective on the balance sheet and monetary policy transmission
Both monetary policy and financial stability considerations are guiding the thinking on the optimal balance sheet in steady state. footnote  To be more specific in the context of the Bank of England and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), and as set out in the Principles of Engagement on the governance of the Bank of England’s balance sheet, the MPC has “decision making authority at the margin, in respect of the deployment of instruments and facilities that are varied over time with the primary intention of affecting overall monetary conditions in order to maintain price stability. […] The MPC will also approve the selection of schemes and structures designed to achieve the price stability objective”. footnote
The MPC’s main monetary policy tool in normal times is Bank Rate, the interest rate on reserves. Bank Rate determines the sterling overnight index average (SONIA), which in turn anchors the short end of the risk-free yield curve, as an important reference rate for transactions. That rate then underpins most forms of money in the economy, such as deposits and interbank lending – which is transmitted through financial markets to affect the entire term structure of risk-free rates, rates on credit, and other asset prices. Since Bank Rate is the anchor for overall financial conditions, monetary policy implementation (frameworks) must ensure that short-term market interest rates remain close to Bank Rate to maintain the appropriate degree of interest rate control.
Prior to the global financial crisis (GFC), short-term money markets played an important role in the distribution and intermediation of Bank Rate from the balance sheet to financial conditions. They facilitated short-term lending and borrowing between banks and other financial institutions to meet liquidity needs. During the GFC, these markets froze as banks became increasingly reluctant to lend to each other due to increased counterparty risks and liquidity hoarding, which in turn made it difficult for them to access liquidity. footnote
Quantitative Easing (QE) footnote  was introduced to complement Bank Rate as another way for monetary policymakers to use the central bank balance sheet to ease monetary conditions and stimulate the economy in response to the GFC. footnote  The focus of the Bank’s QE strategy was on reducing longer-term yields, for which it primarily purchased long-dated government bonds. footnote  With short-term yields at the effective lower bound, and Bank Rate not being able to fall further, this strategy allowed to ease monetary conditions by flattening the yield curve. Research shows that medium to long-term gilt yields fell by about 100 basis points in response to the first £200 billion QE program ( Joyce et al., 2011 ). footnote  There is evidence that the impact on the yield curve of subsequent QE program announcements was less. footnote
Chart 1 shows the outcome of this strategy, and where we are now in terms of yield curve steepness. Historically, yield curves were quite flat – within a range of -1 and 1 percentage point difference between short and long-term yields. The GFC saw a large steepening in the yield curve as short-term interest rates collapsed to zero, but long-term yields were sticky. The decade following the GFC was characterized by a steady flattening in the yield curve, reflecting the effects of QE as well as other factors, including international spillovers. More recently, say over the past two years, the yield curve has again steepened, especially at the very long end (see the orange line). This is unusually steep in historical context, especially given that short-term rates are well above the lower bound.

A consequence of the sequential use of QE (over five rounds between 2009 and 2021), with the purchase of some £875 billion of UK government bonds, was a very large central bank balance sheet. footnote  Active or passive balance sheet run-off footnote  reduces the risk of a ratchet upwards in the size of the balance sheet over time, and thus increases the headroom and flexibility available for the MPC to use the balance sheet in the future if needed. footnote  In 2022, the new global shock of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused inflation to surge. Along with an environment that supported increased Bank Rate, in September 2022, the MPC voted to reduce the stock of gilts through a combination of passive run-off and active sales according to a pre-set plan.
Balance Sheet and New Institutional Design: Fundamentals
The large asset side of the Bank of England’s balance sheet as a result of a large-scale purchase of government bonds during QE required a large expansion of reserves, which were created to finance QE. This large balance sheet expansion means we have been in an abundant (or ‘supply-driven’) reserves system. Because of the surplus of reserves, in excess of demand, financial market participants have no need to pay above Bank Rate to borrow reserves for liquidity or other purposes. And, with reserves remunerated at Bank Rate, financial institutions had little incentive to lend excess reserves at below Bank Rate. footnote  Competition in the market, to borrow funds and place them on account at the Bank of England, ensures that rates on overnight deposits trade close to the remuneration rate paid on reserves, i.e. Bank Rate.
What do such reserves supply regime shifts look like in theory and in the data?
Theory
First the theory, contrasting a scarce and abundant reserves supply regime. I will use simple demand and supply diagrams from Vlieghe (2020) . I will characterize the different approaches as scarce and abundant. While the scarce supply of reserves regime I picture below is not necessarily an accurate representation of any past BoE reserves management regime, it is a useful theoretical base case for comparison. To see how those work, first take the left-hand panel of Chart 2 as a representation of a scarce reserves framework, but with interest on reserves. Under this framework, short-term interest rates are determined by banks trading off their liquidity needs and the cost of holding reserves versus investing them in short-term money markets. This requires an active management of the supply of reserves to match demand, which can be operationally costly for a central bank and it may be difficult to maintain interest rate control.
Chart 2: Stylized representation of the demand and supply for reserves
Scarce (LHS) and abundant (RHS) supply of reserves

The price of reserves is elastic with respect to the aggregate quantity of reserves supplied by the central bank. Thus, shocks to reserves demand shift the aqua line left and right in the short-run (as indicated by the dashed line), causing interest rates to move around. However, there is a kink in the demand curve, beyond which banks no longer compete for reserves. footnote  In this case, on the right panel of Chart 2, demand shocks move neither prices nor quantities because they happen so far off the intersection of flat demand and fixed supply that they cannot change aggregate outcomes. With QE in the aftermath of the GFC, reserves expanded past this point, so money market rates fell close to, but below, Bank Rate and became insensitive to changes in reserves supply.
Now, let’s introduce quantitative tightening (QT). As we progress with QT, there would eventually come a time where the supply of reserves moves from ‘abundant’ to at least some scarcity at least sometimes. This is the kink point in the aggregate demand curve. As my colleague Victoria Saporta laid out in a recent speech , as we move to a demand-driven reserves system, there will come a time when we reach the kink. What happens when the supply of reserves passes this kink point?
In this new institutional framework, interest rate control is achieved through on-demand availability of liquidity through the repo facilities that have been set up to manage the fluctuating demand for reserves.
The short-term repo facility (STR) is intended as our regular market-wide sterling operation aimed at maintaining control of short-term market interest rates – allowing (some) participants to borrow central bank reserves once a week against high quality, highly liquid asset collateral. The facility is priced at Bank Rate and is in unlimited supply. footnote  This effectively sets a ceiling for money market rates at 7-day maturity. The indexed long-term repo facility (ILTR) allows market participants to borrow central bank reserves for a six-month period in exchange for a wider range of collateral. footnote  The rate is indexed to Bank Rate and applies a spread depending on the type of collateral provided and the demand seen in the auction.
What does this new institutional framework look like in the stylized demand and supply framework? Focusing only on the STR for simplicity, this new facility can be represented as a flat supply curve somewhat above the interest on reserves. footnote  It is somewhat above the interest on reserves due to haircuts applied based on collateral provided, and it is flat due to the nature of providing an unlimited supply at that price. Under abundant reserves (as in the QE period), nothing changes (left panel of Chart 3 ) and we should expect little take-up of these facilities. However, once the quantity of reserves supplied inelastically (e.g. through QE) has fallen by enough, commercial banks should begin to access the facilities to satisfy their need for liquidity.
Chart 3: Stylized representation of the demand and supply for reserves
Abundant (LHS) and demand-driven (RHS) framework for reserves with STR
Source: Adapted from Vlieghe (2020) .
This is the case on the right-hand panel of Chart 4 . But it can also be seen that, with the new facilities, prices (i.e. the interest rate) will continue to be unaffected by shocks to reserve demand. In other words, the new facilities are designed to prevent short-lived shocks to reserves demand from causing spikes in money market rates, so that the MPC maintains interest rate control as we run off the APF.
However, this framework also implies that, instead of through price variation, liquidity demand shocks will be reflected in quantities. While this is good news for interest rate control, Goodhart’s law applies: if we have (essentially) fixed the rate in the market underlying the OIS rate, then that market will no longer be informative about stress and liquidity shortages. Instead, these stresses will now be priced by markets largely outside the control of the central bank, for instance in private repo markets. These spreads could be informative regarding the transmission of monetary policy, as well as of financial stability.
In this theoretical set-up there is only one repo facility. But as discussed earlier, there are two: the STR and the ILTR. In principle, the ILTR is intended to supply the majority of reserves in steady state ( Saporta, 2024 ). The design of the ILTR auction is to be responsive to demand. If demand for liquidity in an operation is large, this would result in an increase in the total auction size (across the different sets of eligible collateral) and an increase in the proportion of liquidity allocated to less liquid collateral. In my theoretical diagrams this would be represented as an upward-sloping supply curve. Since the ILTR is designed to have both variable quantities and variable prices, one of its advantages is that it conveys price signals in times of stress. However, one of the uncertainties during the period of transition to the new steady-state balance sheet is the relative uptake across the STR and ILTR. This can determine the degree to which money market rates and other spreads across financial intermediaries could provide a useful signal to monetary policymakers in the future. As these facilities mature, it will be important to consider which data might help identify which theoretical diagram best reflects the transitionary environment as we proceed to normalize the balance sheet.
Data and empirical work
In practice, it will be hard for us to know in real-time on what part of the demand curve for reserves we are. Survey estimates present a wide range. The estimated range for minimum demand for reserves lies between £385 billion and £530 billion. The uncertainty around the demand for reserves might be challenging as we move away from an abundant supply of reserves system and as market participants sort out the secondary dissemination of liquidity from those with access to the repo facilities to those who do not. And the demand for reserves will never be static.
One indicator for the balance between demand and supply of reserves in the system is the difference between SONIA and Bank Rate. footnote  SONIA reflects the average of the interest rates that banks pay to borrow sterling overnight ( Bank of England, 2024 ). Chart 4 plots SONIA and Bank Rate in levels on the top panel, showing that post-GFC, sterling overnight rates have traded close to Bank Rate – suggesting tight interest rate control.

(a) Latest observation: 27 th May 2025
The gap between money market rates and Bank Rate could represent fundamental trends in the underlying macroeconomic environment or could represent institution-specific credit issues. The former signals are important to inform the monetary policy decision-maker. The latter, however, would create an issue for the implementation of monetary policy by creating stress and illiquidity in the market – causing the prevailing overnight rate to float above Bank Rate, and spike (as for instance experienced in the US in 2019, see Anbil et al., 2020 ).
In theory, in a frictionless world, SONIA would be slightly above, or at Bank Rate. In recent history, SONIA has tended to trade a few basis points below Bank Rate (bottom panel of Chart 4 , see footnote 13). As reserves become less abundant, greater competition for borrowing could result in lenders seeking higher returns on their deposits. This would push SONIA higher relative to Bank Rate. The recent upward drift in SONIA relative to Bank Rate may reflect such a reduction in reserves from the system. footnote  Research suggests that such a decline in the difference between banks’ unsecured funding costs and the intended stance of the monetary policymaker, reflected by the wedge between SONIA and Bank Rate in the UK, can help improve the transmission of monetary policy. footnote
Let us consider another measure of the excess demand for reserves in the system. Bank researchers have, over recent months, built upon work by Lopez-Salido and Vissing-Jorgensen (2023) and Afonso et al. (2025) to provide a framework for understanding the demand for reserves. They develop a time-varying version of this framework for the UK, explicitly capturing low-frequency shifts in the curve and the flattening predicted under an abundant reserves regime. footnote
Chart 5 shows the time-varying posterior density of the slope parameter derived from this exercise, i.e. the estimated slope of the reserves demand curve. Consistent with the findings of Afonso et al. (2025) for the US, short-term money market rates in the UK were elastic with respect to the supply of reserves in the early part of the sample. Beginning in 2014, however, as reserves supply expanded beyond 16% of UK nominal GDP, the slope coefficient in this model started to no longer be distinguishable from zero. However, in the most recent data, this has changed. The model now detects a mildly negative slope of the demand curve, consistent with being ‘near the kink’.

(a) The chart shows the posterior median of the long-run slope parameter in a VAR with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility. The swathe shows the 90% posterior credibility region. The model is estimated on ten lags of the spread between untrimmed SONIA and Bank Rate ( McLafferty et al., 2024 ) as well as the quantity of aggregate reserves adjusted by total deposits. Latest observation: 5 th March 2025.
This should not come as a surprise – as reserves have drained from the system over the past year, SONIA has been inching closer to Bank Rate. Meanwhile, take-up of the repo facilities has increased steadily. This behavior is all working as one might expect and consistent with the system working well. But it is also consistent with the inelastic part of reserves supply (the vertical curve in Charts 2 and 3) being to the left of the point of abundance. This is exactly what our theory would predict to happen. Therefore, we expect there to be more volatility in the quantity of reserves demanded – and indeed the quantity demanded will be endogenous to the terms we supply (and also to the degree of volatility around Bank Rate ( Saporta, 2024 )).
While there is consensus that balance sheet sizes should be reduced, there is no obvious answer to the right pace at which this should be reduced, or to what end point. After more than a decade of ‘abundant’ reserves, and with changes in banking regulation and other institutional features following the GFC, the signal of the underlying demand for reserves is distorted, and therefore the optimal size of the balance sheet – though we know it is very likely larger than pre-GFC levels. footnote  So, on balance sheet normalization, unlike with policy rates, central banks are in uncharted territory. In conjunction with the theoretical derivation and empirical evidence, this has important monetary policy implications as we head into the September decision on next year’s balance sheet run-off, given the indication that we have been moving away from the flat part of the demand curve.
With these fundamentals of institutional designs moving forward, what issues might affect monetary policy transmission or stance?
New Institutional Design and Monetary Policy Questions
Does the strategy of balance sheet normalization create a tension with the desire to ease monetary policy in the current period, via reductions in the primary tool of the MPC, that is, Bank Rate? I will answer this question in the next section.
For me, this new design raises a few additional questions relating directly to the conduct of monetary policy. I put out these questions mainly for transparency because I am actively considering them, but also because they are interesting fields of inquiry for academic research.
(1) As more financial institutions use the various repo facilities, how will the signals they provide via usage and spreads influence the monetary policy transmission mechanism and therefore MPC decision-making? footnote
(2) Does balance sheet normalization affect the restrictiveness of monetary policy by affecting the neutral rate of interest through its effect on convenience yields? footnote
(3) Do alternative institutional designs for balance sheet normalization across borders create financial market spillovers that matter for monetary policy, or undesired arbitrage opportunities? footnote
Quantitative tension?
As set out in the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report , the MPC’s preference is to use Bank Rate as its active instrument. footnote  QT is often called ‘QE in reverse’ – because it requires the running down of these purchased assets, and a destruction of reserves in the process. However, it is not QE in reverse – the use of asset purchases as a monetary policy tool is asymmetric. footnote  Unlike Bank Rate, which is used to ease and tighten the monetary stance, the MPC did use QE to ease monetary conditions. But QT is not intended as a tool to tighten monetary conditions, for various reasons, including the fact that the sales are designed to be gradual and predictable, in the background, and, unlike QE, are conducted during calm times rather than times of markets or economic stress. footnote  Critically, QT is not supposed to reveal anything about plans for future policy or our reaction function. footnote  But even then, it is not far-fetched that the QT strategy still might affect monetary and financial conditions.
In practice, in the UK context under current arrangements, QE and QT boil down to decisions made by the MPC on controlling the amount and maturity structure of gilts held in the APF. Growing or shrinking the APF has a direct effect on the size of the Bank’s balance sheet. footnote  There is an element of the stock (the size of the APF) and the flow (purchases and sales of gilts held in the APF).
The Bank holds, on average, and in international comparison, a portfolio of more long-dated government bonds, which is in line with the UK government debt overall having a longer maturity structure in international comparison. This is why the Bank, more specifically the MPC, has been undertaking a mix of passive balance sheet run-off as bonds mature, and active sales – aimed at reducing the size of the APF. footnote
QE works by lowering longer-term yields through the purchase of longer-term bonds, that pushes prices up, and yields down, with duration removed from the market. What about QT when we sell gilts and add back duration? Ramsden (2023) noted that the impact of QT on monetary conditions had been very small to date, by comparing yield curve movements on date of QT auctions with non-auction days. footnote  Joyce and Lengyel (2024) show empirically that, subject to market conditions, a fully unanticipated increase in duration supply to the private sector, mimicking the Bank’s first annual QT program of £80 billion, could raise 10-year yields by some 20 basis points. In a world where we are gradually reducing the restrictiveness of monetary policy – so far at a pace of 25 basis points each quarter, this could be significant. Especially since the total envelope has since grown to £280 billion by September 2025. footnote
Taking these magnitudes as given, could I just offset the QT-implied tightening with an extra Bank Rate cut over the course of a year? It is unlikely that there is such an easy equivalence, as illustrated in Chart 6 . The left panel shows, in a stylized way, that QE reduces long-term yields when Bank Rate is at the effective lower bound (ELB). On the right panel, I show the effects of QT. Assume our starting point is a yield curve (purple color) with Bank Rate away from the ELB and therefore pinning down the short end of the yield curve. Now also assume that QT raises long-term yields which steepens the curve (moving from the purple to the gold line). A monetary policymaker may seek to offset that tightening with a cut in Bank Rate, leading to the shift from the gold to the pink line. Comparing the purple and pink lines, is this equivalent from the perspective of the monetary stance?
Chart 6: Illustrative moves in the yield curve under QE and QT
QE (LHS) and QT (RHS)
Because the monetary policymaker can only really control the short end (through Bank Rate and changes in interest rate expectations), tightening from QT and loosening from Bank Rate acts differently on different parts of the yield curve. The shape and steepness of the yield curve matters for different parts of the monetary policy transmission mechanism – therefore I would argue that this is an imperfect substitution and may have effects on the transmission of monetary policy that need to be further explored. Odendahl et al. (2024) for instance find, for the euro area, that how the term structure of interest rates changes in response to both conventional and unconventional monetary policy announcements matters for macroeconomic outcomes.
Specifically, the authors find that the shape of monetary policy surprises change the inflation and output response to a given monetary policy shock. Using a counterfactual analysis where they simulate several policy instruments available to the monetary policymaker that affect different parts of the yield curve, the authors can separate macroeconomic effects of a level shift in the yield curve, versus a change in the slope. They find that macroeconomic variables are most influenced by changes at the longer end of the yield curve. More specifically, a surprise with the same cumulative change in the term structure, but with different signs at the short and long ends of the yield curve (deep cuts at the short end that are offset by increases in the longer end) have larger tightening effects on inflation and output.
Bank researchers have conducted a similar exercise for the UK using the monetary policy shocks database of Braun et al. (2025) and find that a shock that steepens the yield curve (short rates falling more than long rates) is contractionary rather than expansionary for the economy – with inflation falling, in line with the euro area results.
In light of this evidence, it is important for a monetary policymaker to consider the interactions of QT and policy rate decisions, especially at a time where these two tools are acting in different directions. Since potential tightening effects of QT cannot be perfectly offset by cuts in Bank Rate, because they generate a different set of monetary and financial conditions, the combination of tools and their macroeconomic effects must be carefully considered.
Turning back to the MPC’s strategy for the mix of monetary policy instruments (see Box A of the August 2021 Monetary Policy Report ) – some might argue that the short and long-run yield curve effects of QT and Bank Rate I outline are an expected consequence of choosing, collectively as the MPC, that Bank Rate is the active tool and QT is in the background. I agree. However, this was outlined in the context of policy tightening – when QT and Bank Rate were working in the same direction. Now that the MPC is reducing restrictiveness, I believe that we need to consider the differing effects of our policies (whether in the fore- or background) on different parts of the yield curve and their effects on monetary policy transmission as a more salient issue. That being said, taking movements in the yield curve as given, we can always set policy to achieve our inflation target using our active tool, Bank Rate.
Conclusion
With the next QT decision in September 2025 not far off, the median respondent in the most recent Market Participants Survey expects the MPC to reduce the amount of gilt holdings by £75 billion. How much does this reduction in the balance sheet over the next 12 months move us towards the downward-sloping part of the demand curve for reserves, with an associated further uptake in our repo facilities?
In principle, the size of the balance sheet would be whatever is needed to supply sufficient reserves to the banking system (determined by a multitude of factors such as the attractiveness of our facilities, the level of reserves required to hold for financial stability or precautionary reasons, and the level of interest rates).
Therefore, the question for a monetary policymaker is less about the size of the balance sheet than its strategy of normalization, with both remaining stock and flow of assets, and the associated effects on monetary conditions. As discussed above, asset run-off and asset sales can influence monetary transmission by affecting different parts of the yield curve. If large enough, this needs to be incorporated into my future interest rate decisions. Just as I have noted in other speeches that other types of spillovers into UK financial conditions have affected my decisions on the appropriate level of Bank Rate.
In this specific example of QT, I showed that trying to offset increases in long rates by cutting short rates by more than otherwise is not equivalent. First, because a Bank Rate cut cannot perfectly compensate for tightening at the long-end of the yield curve and second, because an additional cut in this cycle of Bank Rate reduction, so as to try to compensate for tightening at the long end, could run counter to the need to maintain restrictiveness for long enough to purge the structural rigidities in labor and product markets that I have often noted are key to my Bank Rate decisions.
No doubt many of these issues will be part of the MPC considerations in the run-up to the next decision on QT in September, for 2025-26.

Speech
Introduction
It’s a pleasure to be here in Helsinki for this year’s conference on ‘Old Wisdoms and New Trends’.
For more than a decade, a number of central banks, including the Bank of England, expanded their balance sheets by purchasing assets financed by abundant reserves as part of Quantitative Easing (QE) programmes. Over recent years, most central banks, including the Bank, have started the process of balance sheet normalisation. The key question we have all been asking is what does the new norm look like?
At the Bank of England we have been grappling with this question for a number of years. In 2023, my predecessor, Andrew Hauser, gave a speech confirming our intention to return to a demand-driven operating framework but one where we are going to be supplying more reserves than before the global financial crisis and laid down the pros and cons of large versus small central bank balance sheets. footnote  In 2024, the Governor, Andrew Bailey, and I gave speeches in which we confirmed our intention to supply the majority of our reserves through lending facilities (repo); in my speech, I also emphasised the importance of firms’ readiness to actively borrow from all our facilities, which are ‘open for business’. footnote
These speeches were followed by a discussion paper (DP) that set out in more detail our new operating framework and sought feedback including on the calibration of one of our core lending facilities, the Indexed Long-Term Repo (ILTR) facility footnote  .
Today we are publishing a Market Notice footnote  , a guide explaining how to bid effectively in the ILTR facility and a feedback statement that sets out our response to the valuable feedback we received. We have also updated and improved our online market operations guide for participants. I encourage all market participants to read these materials carefully.
In these remarks I would like to set out the key features of our operating framework and how they have grown out of a process of active learning – learning from our own history, learning from the public debate, learning from market participants and learning from observing how the framework works in practice: learning by doing . I will also highlight some key messages I would like market participants to focus on. As in the previous speeches on the Bank’s operating framework I just mentioned, I will refer to quantitative easing and tightening, but these programmes are not my focus for today.
Our new operating framework
Starting with the key features of our operating framework.
As this audience is well aware, reserves are market participants’ deposits at the central bank. A central bank’s operating framework is the set of market operations through which it supplies reserves to the market. footnote  The terms of these operations guide the price of money in short-term markets and provide liquidity insurance to the banking system. footnote  This is the reason why our operating framework is core to both monetary policy and financial stability.
The briefest comparison of international operating frameworks or, for that matter, the Bank’s own history demonstrates that central banks can and have operated with very different levels of reserves. footnote  In the UK, reserves reached a historical high in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and are now falling as we unwind quantitative easing (QE) and a crisis-era lending scheme is being repaid (Chart 1).

Going forward, the Bank intends to let the level of reserves be driven by our counterparties’ demand in the lending facilities we offer them – we refer to these as our ‘repo facilities’ and the resulting framework as ‘repo-led, demand-driven’.
We have two weekly, market-wide facilities to supply the majority of reserves to the market, the Short-Term Repo facility (STR) and the Indexed Long-Term Repo (ILTR).
The STR supplies unlimited reserves for one week against high quality collateral at Bank Rate. The Bank’s haircuts on this collateral tend to be higher, on average, than the market’s and firms need to take into account balance sheet costs when they borrow from us. As a result, we estimate that the average all-in cost of the facility is around 5-10bps above Bank Rate. The time series of overnight repo rates in Chart 2 shows that on average repo rates are trading within the all-in cost range of the STR, suggesting that it is doing a good job at capping secured money market rates.
Chart 2: Money market interest rates as a spread to Bank Rate

The ILTR supplies reserves against the full range of SMF-eligible collateral at a variable price and quantity for six months, at a minimum clearing spread of 15bps above Bank rate for our broadest collateral set (‘Level C collateral’). As demand for the ILTR grows the facility is designed to align with comparable market rates. footnote  We also have two bilateral standing facilities that can be tapped on any day of the week, on demand: the Operational Standing Facility (OSF) which lends reserves at 25bps above Bank rate and the Discount Window facility (DWF). footnote
As Chart 3 shows, usage of our weekly lending facilities have been steadily increasing, which we encourage and welcome. footnote  Currently, we have lent £68bn in the Short-Term Repo (STR) and £23bn in the ILTR footnote  . While not easily identifiable from the longer time series in Charts 2 and 3, over the past year, STR usage has tended to decline somewhat before quarter-ends, during which times banks seek to manage down their balance sheets temporarily for regulatory reasons. This balance sheet management activity – which is anticipated and understood well by us and market participants – is also reflected in    short-term spikes in overnight repo rates around quarter ends that are then brought down through greater STR usage. footnote  Nonetheless the stock of reserves continues to fall, as the decline in reserves resulting from the unwind of QE and a crisis-era lending scheme (TFSME) continues to outpace growing usage of our lending facilities (Chart 4). For now, these facilities are smoothing bumps in the road as we transition towards a new equilibrium. We are watching carefully for where that level will settle.

Source: Bank of England(a) Reserves drain stripping out the increase in borrowing in STR and ILTR (purple line) excludes borrowing in the STR and ILTR after July 2023.
We cannot know ex-ante what that level will be and since we are not operating a supply-driven system, we do not need to rely on accurate estimates of demand to determine how much we supply. That said, it is useful to have such estimates, for planning purposes, including by asking banks what is their preferred minimum range of reserves (PMRR). footnote  The latest survey suggests that PMRR is £385-540bn, marginally higher than £385-530bn in Q3 2024. footnote
Chart 2 shows a time series of the spread between SONIA and Bank Rate. Although the spread has been narrowing it is still negative. In an environment of falling reserves and upwards pressure in repo markets, depositors in overnight unsecured markets have been able to demand a higher rate of return on their deposits with SMF banks. We would expect the spread to narrow further as reserves and deposits reach their preferred level.
So far, so good. The operating framework we have designed is transitioning to an equilibrium level of reserves well – secured money market (repo) rates are being capped by our marginal facility and unsecured rates are slowly increasing towards their new level.  At the same time, participants are increasingly tapping our longer-term facility that alongside the STR will supply the majority of reserves, which is welcome and a process we would like to see continuing.
We need to recognise that we can only know whether our operating framework achieves its monetary control and financial stability objectives once we have experienced stress after reserves have settled at the PMRR. In the meantime, we can ensure that our design best reflects the lessons from the past, the public debate and what our market analysis and our market participants are telling us. I will now turn to these lessons to persuade you that it does.
Lessons from history
Our framework seeks to build on the lessons we learned from operating a variety of frameworks before the global financial crisis and during the era of QE asset purchases. Let me give a brief overview of what we’ve learned from these experiences.
Before 2006, the Bank ran an operationally intensive framework of multiple daily operations to supply a small number of large commercial banks with just enough reserves to settle intra-day payments. Compared to today, bank balances held overnight at the central bank (i.e. the reserve supply) were extremely low because we actively disincentivised banks from holding any more reserves than was strictly necessary. This complex, scarce-reserves framework came at the cost of significant overnight rate volatility.
The year 2006 marked a major shift in our framework when we started to pay interest on reserves. footnote  This incentivised banks to hold positive reserve balances: the reserve supply increased from the tens of millions to the tens of billions. This enabled our counterparties to absorb short-term fluctuations in reserves demand without causing volatility in market rates. By remunerating reserves at Bank Rate, we anchored short-term market rates to the Monetary Policy Committee’s chosen policy rate – a core feature of the framework that remains in place today. Put simply, we implement monetary policy through the interest we pay on reserves, and this has delivered a significant improvement in our ability to steer market rates. Chart 5 shows the decline in overnight volatility starting in May 2006.

In addition to remunerated reserves, this framework – known as reserves averaging – had two main elements: voluntary reserves targets set by participants themselves, and weekly lending operations. In many respects, it resembles the framework to which we are transitioning today – you could say it was repo-led and demand-driven. It performed well at implementing monetary policy under normal market conditions. However, as my colleagues have detailed elsewhere, it proved inadequate when it encountered stress in the form of the global financial crisis. footnote
The most important lesson we drew from that period – others are summarised in         Table A – was that rigid individual reserve targets were not resilient to sudden shifts in aggregate demand. Penalties for deviating from targets and the stigma associated with accessing bilateral standing facilities limited the system’s flexibility to rapidly scale up reserves supply. This weakened the Bank’s ability to effectively implement and transmit monetary policy. And when this interacted with widespread credit concerns in liquidity and funding markets, the framework’s reliance on a relatively small number of firms to distribute reserves to the wider financial system broke down: liquidity could not reach the parts of the system where it was needed most.

Lesson
Response
Reserves averaging
1. Requiring firms to manage reserves to rigid individual targets is not robust to large shocks to aggregate reserves demand (and supply) – and so weakens control of short-term market rates
A demand-driven system that facilitates adjustments in reserve supply in response to market price signals is most likely to maintain control of market rates
2. Regular and normalised usage of central bank lending facilities in normal conditions is critical to expanding reserves supply in stress
SMF facilities are ‘open for business’ – usage should be seen as routine liquidity management
3. Reliance on a small number of firms to distribute reserves to the wider financial system poses risks to financial stability during stress

Supply-driven abundant reserves framework
5. Abundant reserves have been highly effective at guiding market rates, including during stress, but transfer interest rate risk from the private sector to the public sector when supplied by asset purchases
The Bank’s balance sheet will remain larger than before the financial crisis though not as large as today and be backed by repo
In 2009, we suspended much of the reserves averaging framework to accommodate the excess reserves created to fund the MPC’s programme of asset purchases. This shift marked the beginning of a supply-driven abundant reserves framework in which the design of our operations was shaped largely by the objectives of QE. Although in this period market-wide lending facilities were rarely used outside stress episodes, we introduced several important innovations that now underpin our repo-led, demand-driven approach. These innovations include a fundamental change in the positioning and supervisory treatment of our facilities footnote  , the widening of access to our framework (from around 40 counterparties in 2006 to over 225 today footnote  ), as well as new and normalised facilities like the STR and ILTR, the latter of which is available against a broad range of collateral.

One of the key insights from this period was that abundant reserves supply could be highly effective at guiding short-term market rates, including during financial-stability driven shocks (Chart 6). However, when reserves are supplied via outright gilt purchases, an abundant reserves framework transfers a substantial amount of interest rate risk from the private sector to the public sector. As Andrew Bailey explained in his Goodhart lecture, footnote  a repo-led framework allows the bulk of interest rate risk to be managed in the private sector, where it better belongs.
Learning from the public debate
How do the lessons from our operating framework history stack up against the public debate on the subject?
Here at the Bank, we have profited from a wide range of central bank research conferences and public discussions that have considered the design of central bank balance sheets. And in February this year, the Bank of England hosted its own Annual Research conference on this theme footnote  . Annette Vissing-Jorgensen of the Federal Reserve Board gave a keynote speech based on contributions she and her co-authors have made in the field. In her presentation she demonstrated an important result: given that central banks are monopolist suppliers of reserves, demand is endogenous to the terms of supply and hence central banks can always achieve monetary control. footnote
Given that a variety of operational framework can achieve monetary control, the question then becomes which operational framework is more robust to shocks. To get a sense of this, take the Bank’s experience with reserves averaging and the supply-driven abundant reserves framework we have been operating since QE. During normal times, we were able to maintain monetary control well, but as soon as stress crystallised, reserves averaging did less well in maintaining control. The Bank did succeed in maintaining control but after significant innovations and introductions of new schemes, which effectively resulted in an abandonment of the original operating framework. Put differently, although it’s always possible for the monopolist supplier of reserves to keep overnight rates close to its policy target, only certain operating frameworks appear to be robust to unanticipated shifts in demand and supply.
In terms of which framework is more robust, Chart 7 shows a demand curve for reserves with three stylised segments: scarce reserves, ample reserves and abundant reserves. footnote  Our own experience with QE suggests that abundant or ample reserves systems that ensure central banks do not hit the most inelastic part of the demand curve are robust to sudden increases in demand and are very good at delivering monetary control. But are they optimal from a welfare perspective?
Chart 7: Stylised reserves demand curve (a)
(a) For illustrative purposes we have assigned colours to different regimes of reserves supply. In reality, the boundary between each regime is porous, and so we would not expect to see sudden shifts from ample to scarce reserves, for example.
To answer this question a natural starting point – emphasised by the Dallas Fed’s Lorie Logan – is the classical Friedman rule in which the ‘opportunity cost to banks of holding reserves is approximately equal to the central bank’s cost of supplying reserves’. 10 Such a rule would imply that the central bank expands reserve supply until demand is satiated at the prevailing policy rate, given that reserve supply is argued to essentially be costless.
But in a separate contribution, Vissing-Jorgensen footnote  has accounted for the fact that reserves provision is not costless. Reserves need to be supplied either through the central bank purchasing assets, usually government bonds, or lending against collateral. When purchasing assets, the central bank removes these assets from the financial system by taking title of them. But different assets offer different convenience value related to their inherent liquidity value – that is they confer different benefits from holding them over and above the interest rate they yield. For example, government bonds have a higher convenience value for a broad range of market participants, than illiquid assets such as loans because they are more easily monetisable in financial markets and they can also be used to fulfil regulatory requirements such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). So the Friedman rule ought to be adjusted to take account of not only the marginal cost a central bank faces in supplying reserves but also the marginal welfare cost of removing assets with convenience value from the market. This gives rise to Vissing-Jorgensen’s extension of the Friedman rule. Put differently, it is not only balance sheet size that matters, but also asset composition and the latter influences the former. A central bank that in steady state supplies all of its reserves through gilt purchases should optimally have a smaller balance sheet than a central bank that supplies a material stock of its reserves through active lending against a broad set of collateral, other factors being equal.
What does this mean in practical terms? I think it still implies ample central bank balance sheets, as shown in Chart 7, but by accounting for marginal welfare costs, it implies less abundance than the pure Friedman rule would suggest. A larger balance sheet, as we have seen from our QE experience, is more robust to sudden shifts in demand. And if lending can be conducted against a broad set of collateral then this allows the central bank to aim for a larger balance sheet than if it supplied it mainly through government bond purchases.
There are two reasonable challenges to this position. The first is that the market’s ability to effectively distribute reserves affects both their convenience value and that of other assets. Claudio Borio, formerly at the BIS, has noted that higher levels of reserve supply could weaken market functioning, depth and the efficiency of intermediation. footnote  In this world, less efficient money markets for liquidating high-quality collateral might lower their convenience value to investors relative to reserves, shifting the demand curve for reserves outward in normal times, further undermining the efficiency of liquidity and funding markets, or producing larger-than-otherwise demand shocks in stress with consequences for financial stability.
In the UK, there is little empirical evidence that abundant reserves have harmed activity in money markets (Chart 8). Granted, unsecured interbank activity is much less likely to play a role in liquidity management footnote  but secured money market activity, both between banks and between banks and non-banks does not seem to have been affected by the injection of abundant reserves. Moreover, by stabilising market conditions, ample reserves may actually support market liquidity and broader market functioning, as Roberto Perli has recently argued, including in the recent tariff-related turmoil in early April. footnote
The second challenge to the case for ample reserve supply in normal market conditions is that it fails to account properly for the central bank’s ability to expand reserves supply rapidly in stress. In this view, in a flight-to-safety scenario, the convenience value of reserves is likely to increase relative to other assets. So assessments of the optimal level of reserve supply based on measures of convenience value in normal market conditions may be inconsistent with measures of convenience value in stress. Borio therefore argues not only that the central bank balance sheet should be small in normal times to nurture healthy markets but that they should expand elastically in stress when markets are not functioning well.
However, the effective expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet cannot simply be taken for granted. There are a wide-range of policy, operational and stigma-related frictions that, if not addressed, can undermine the speed and scale at which market operations are able to expand reserve supply in stress footnote  . Put simply, we judge that our ability to expand reserve supply is likely to work far more effectively if lending facilities are used regularly and widely by our counterparties in normal times – as we are now starting to see through borrowing in the STR and ILTR. footnote  The more counterparties are comfortable that they are able to draw in scale from our facilities in stress the less likely they are to demand in normal times. Practically, a framework based on active lending against broad collateral still implies a reasonably ample level of reserves in normal market conditions.

Pre-July 2017 data are estimates derived from Bankstats to match the wider coverage of SMMD. QE periods refer to when the Bank was actively increasing the stock of assets in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) for QE purposes.
There is a further consideration here. For a central bank to expand reserve supply elastically in stress, there needs to be sufficient unencumbered and eligible collateral in circulation: so-called ‘dry powder’ to meet the increased demand for reserves in stress. Supplying a large quantity of reserves through lending against broad collateral in normal times can leave less ‘dry powder’ in the banking sector. While we are still in transition and cannot know with certainty where reserves will settle, reasonable estimates suggest that the increase in the level of encumbrance involved, at least in aggregate, will be quite modest, and will leave plenty of dry powder in circulation which can be used for borrowing reserves in stress (Chart 9). So at this stage I do not put much weight on this point; once reserves have settled at their new level, we can reassess available dry powder against plausible estimates of needs in stress.

Learning from the market
Learning from the past and from public debate can take us only so far. We also need to test our approach through continuous engagement with the market – and especially the participants in our framework.
We do that regularly – the Bank’s robust qualitative and quantitative market intelligence function supports policymaking across our remits. We speak regularly with the breadth of participants in our operations to get their view on the design of our facilities and broader market conditions. Engaging with the market in this way has been an ongoing process, helping us to iterate on the design of our framework.
The transition to a repo-led, demand-driven framework is a major change in operating practice, both for us and firms. This is why we felt it was important to set out our thinking at greater length in a DP last December and invited formal feedback. We have today put out a feedback statement to that DP – and here I will talk through a few key points.
A key purpose of the DP was to outline our proposals to recalibrate the ILTR, to make it fit for purpose to supply the stock of reserves, alongside the STR.
We received 61 responses, primarily from SMF participants and a variety of trade associations. Respondents generally supported our approach to the recalibration of ILTR which involves supplying a larger total amount available per weekly auction, an increase in the quantity of reserves available at fixed minimum spreads, and a gentler upward sloping supply curve than before to ensure that clearing spreads only rise gradually.
The Bank will continue to review the ILTR to ensure it remains effective and aligned with market conditions. From November 2025, the minimum spread on bids against Level A collateral in the ILTR will rise from 0 to 3 basis points above Bank Rate. By introducing a modest spread above Bank Rate, this change is intended to balance incentives for participants between the STR and ILTR facilities against Level A collateral by more closely aligning the effective costs of the facilities given the longer tenor of the ILTR. This change will be confirmed in advance, with no changes planned for Level B or C collateral.
Some respondents asked for further clarity about how the ILTR pricing and allocation work, especially as and when demand increases. We’ve published a new ILTR guide for participants to address this. The guide provides practical guidance for firms and example auction outcomes which demonstrate principles for how to bid effectively in the ILTR.
Many respondents welcomed the increase in transparency around the facility’s pricing and design. However, a number of respondents also asked for greater flexibility around the tenor of loan – either in the form of shorter maturity options or the option to repay ILTR drawings early. While we are making no changes now, as we transition to the steady state framework we will review whether increasing the flexibility offered by the ILTR could improve its usability without undermining the facility’s integrity as a competitive auction.
Some respondents requested greater clarity on the role of the Operational Standing Facilities (OSFs) and the Discount Window Facility (DWF) in a repo-led framework. We expect the OSFs and DWF to both play an important role in our framework, alongside our regular market-wide operations. As with all SMF facilities, the OSFs and DWF are ‘open for business’ and should be used by SMF participants for the purposes of liquidity management. footnote
Firms recognised that OSFs could play a role in responding to shocks in demand for reserves which occur outside of the ILTR or STR auction window. However, given some comments from firms that they would use OSFs only as a last resort, we intend to review the current design and effectiveness of OSFs and we will engage with the market as part of this piece of work.
In addition, several respondents set out changes to the Bank’s current collateral eligibility and settlement processes that in their view would enhance the overall usability of the Bank’s facilities to SMF firms. We’ve engaged with that thoroughly in the feedback statement, and welcome further engagement on these topics – it’s vital that operational robustness and effective risk management processes enable effective usage of our facilities.
To sum up this section, I want to reiterate our thanks to all the respondents to the discussion paper for their engagement with our proposals. We invite continued engagement on these issues as we go through the next stage of transition. And the next stage of transition, for us and for firms, is the topic I will now move to.
Learning by doing
I would like to finish by making the case that this will be an ongoing process of learning by doing – not just for the Bank, but also for firms. That’s because, as we’ve said before, we will continue to learn as the liquidity environment changes, including how market liquidity conditions – particularly in liquidity and funding markets – evolve. As conditions evolve, so too will the Bank’s approach. Change won’t happen overnight – we fully appreciate the value of certainty and planning. But it would be surprising if we hadn’t reflected on the precise calibration of our facilities in, say, a few years’ time. Any changes would be clearly signalled to the market: we will continue to update our framework in a gradual and predictable way, ensuring that the liquidity of sterling markets supports our objectives of monetary and financial stability.
An ongoing open dialogue with SMF participants and interested parties will be critical to ensuring a smooth transition to the new framework. Over time, more frequent participation from a broader range of firms will be essential for supplying the system with the liquidity it needs. The PRA statements on the STR and ILTR are clear on the fact that our lending facilities should be seen as routine. footnote  I want to emphasise that firms should now be looking to use these facilities for routine liquidity management and not just as backstops. It has been welcome to see a broadening range of institutions in these operations, and we want to see more.
Chart 10 sets out the path for reserves together with the latest survey-based PMRR estimate I referred to earlier taking into account projected decline of reserves due to QE and TFSME unwind. The path of TFSME unwind has become smoother as more firms have repaid their drawings. This would suggest we could arrive at the upper range of this estimate by Q2 2026. Exactly when we reach this level will depend amongst other things on changes in our facilities usage, as well as the pace of QT (which is a decision for the MPC). But it sharpens the mind as a planning assumption.
Chart 10: We could reach the PMRR next year (a)
Source: Bank of England(a) Reserve unwind shown under different stylised MPC scenarios for QT, based on the different choices during the first three QT annual review cycle. For simplicity it assumes no further change to STR or ILTR usage.
By engaging actively, planning thoughtfully, and being adaptive to change, firms support a smooth transition to a repo-led framework. That means that SMF firms must now fully consider the changing liquidity environment, and their plans to source reserves within that. That means borrowing in larger volumes routinely from the Bank, considering their market access, testing operations regularly and thinking actively about levels of pre-positioned collateral – both for use in market-wide and our bilateral on-demand standing facilities. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to liquidity management, but firms should not assume that their use of our facilities in the future will be the same as their use today. The liquidity environment is changing. That’s also why we’re running virtual seminars on our facilities (a so-called SMF showcase) to build familiarity and readiness across treasury, repo, and operational teams. The message is clear: the Bank’s facilities are open for business – use them, learn by doing, and be ready to adapt as market conditions and pricing evolves.
We will do the same.

An important research question is whether the demise of unsecured interbank markets matters in a world where we know that in the presence of credit and liquidity shocks in the banking system they do not appear to work. One argument is that in their absence we do not have sufficient signals of credit and liquidity distress, although there are many other asset prices that can produce such signals such as CDS spreads, spreads on Tier 1 and Tier 2 bonds and equity prices.

From trading floors to policy calls: the value and evolution of our interactions with financial markets − speech by Andrea Rosen
In this speech, Andrea Rosen announces a new initiative: the Market Participants Group – a senior-level forum for the Monetary Policy Committee to hear directly from financial market participants.
She also discusses how, amidst a rapidly evolving global environment, the Bank’s ability to understand, monitor and analyse market developments and structure - as well as to interact and communicate effectively with financial markets - has become even more crucial.
Speech
Good morning, and thanks for the opportunity to speak at this very timely conference.
I joined the Bank of England in 2020 after many years working in financial markets. My time at the Bank has not been calm. But it has been fascinating, and I have been lucky enough to experience it from a unique vantage point – first as Head of Market Intelligence and Analysis, then as Head of Sterling Markets, and now as Director of Markets.
Having been on both sides, I have some perspective on the symbiotic relationship between financial markets and policymaking. Markets take all available information at a given time, overlay their perception of the policy reaction function, and reflect that in asset prices. Policymakers then take market pricing and expectations as an input into their deliberations. They rely on markets as a key transmission mechanism for their decisions into the real economy and try not to insert unnecessary volatility into that process through clear and careful communications. Both markets and policymakers try to anticipate each other’s moves as new information emerges. The ideal situation is one where the market understands policymakers…and policymakers can rely on the information value of market pricing. Of course, the reality tends to be much more complicated than that.
An important job for the Markets area of the Bank is to ensure that the relevant decisions and actions taken across our monetary policy and financial stability remits are up to date on market conditions and expectations, as well as grounded by our analysis, judgement and experience operating in financial markets. The Bank and its Committees may not always deliver what financial markets want or expect but having the context to make informed decisions matters.
As I explained in 2022 , the Bank’s market intelligence function is a key component of that effort, combining our qualitative assessment based on a broad network of relationships with market participants, with market data, models and surveys.
But the Bank’s interaction with financial markets goes much further and positions us well for interpreting what is happening in the world around us. We implement monetary policy and provide liquidity insurance to the financial system through our balance sheet; administer the UK’s risk-free rate ; and act as an investor and agent in global rates and FX through our reserves management function. All while ensuring that our balance sheet remains protected from undue financial risk.
The Bank’s extensive presence in financial markets means that we are well placed to provide regular, informed and timely judgements to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Those efforts will continue. We also see value in MPC members periodically engaging directly with market participants in a systematic, structured and transparent manner, mirroring the approach that our central bank peers have in place.
In this context, and as part of the Monetary Policy Transformation Programme that we are discussing at this conference, I am here to announce a new initiative: the Bank of England Market Participants Group (MPG ).
This will be a senior-level forum for financial market participants to directly share their views with MPC members in a roundtable setting. It will meet three to four times a year and draw on experts across UK and global markets, to cover topics relevant to the UK economy and monetary policy making process. MPG members will be selected through an application process, and the minutes and agenda of each meeting will be available to the broader market and public, ensuring transparency. We will also continue speaking with a diverse set of market participants through our market intelligence function and relaying that information to the MPC on a regular basis.
Before I expand on the MPG, let me build on how the Bank already interacts with, and learns from, financial markets to shape and deliver effective policy making.
Markets at the Bank of England
Achieving monetary and financial stability in a more shock-prone world requires clarity. We have had our fair share of shocks over the past few years. And amidst a rapidly evolving and uncertain global environment, our ability to understand, monitor and analyse market developments and structure - as well as to operate and communicate effectively in financial markets - has become even more crucial.
The Bank's integrated approach to market intelligence, policy design, and operations means that we can consistently interact with - and learn from markets - which then informs our policy work and advice (Figure 1).
Figure 1: The Bank of England’s Markets Directorate
Our approach to market intelligence and analysis goes beyond simply monitoring asset prices — it involves staying on top of global market narratives and sentiment, testing prevailing views against empirical evidence, considering market liquidity and functioning, and placing UK developments within an international and cross-asset framework (Figure 2). footnote
Financial markets are, at heart, stories we tell about the future, priced in the present. Regularly speaking with a wide range of people across markets is therefore hugely important. It adds qualitative interpretations and nuance that might not be obvious from publicly available data alone, and it helps us stay one step ahead on key themes. We deliberately seek out a range of views from a diverse set of contacts, footnote  and aim to present an aggregate picture of market narratives at any given time, informed by our staff’s judgement and experience.
We are grateful to everyone who speaks with us in this context: from buy- and sell-side traders, strategists and economists, to bank and building society Treasurers, to industry bodies, to the UK Money Markets Committee and the London Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee , which we chair.
Figure 2: Our Market Intelligence and Analysis function
The UK is a relatively small open economy with a large financial sector, and our core markets are highly interconnected with the rest of the world. Therefore, as well as continuous engagement with global market participants, we are in close contact with our official sector peers on both conjunctural and structural market themes. We do this bilaterally at all levels, and through multilateral fora including the BIS Markets Committee and the Global Foreign Exchange Committee .
There is also tremendous value in challenging or supporting what we hear from markets with what we see in markets. In that context, we regularly use trade-level data to look for signals about how liquidity is making its way through the financial system, footnote  how positioning is impacting market pricing, how markets are functioning in volatile times, and other important questions (see Figure 3 for some examples of our use of transactions data). Of course, the data tell us about things as they are, not as they will be. They also don’t tell us much about the ‘why’. So, it is always important to use our market experience and intelligence to complement our dashboards, to test what we see and interpret what it may mean.
Figure 3: Examples of our use of market transactions data
At any given point, the Bank isn’t just observing what is happening in markets. We are actively participating in them, mainly through our sterling and FX balance sheet operations, as well as our role managing the UK’s foreign exchange reserves on behalf of the Government.
Our Sterling Markets Division (SMD) is, in a way, what makes the Bank of England a bank. Indeed, as Lord Cobbold, former Governor of the Bank of England, is reputed once to have said, ‘A central bank is a bank, not a study group’. footnote  The Markets area is responsible for operations relating to the Bank’s sterling balance sheet, which peaked at over £1 trillion in 2022, and at present stands at over £750 billion. footnote
The balance sheet is used to implement the MPC’s policy decisions. We provide bilateral and market-wide liquidity facilities as part of the Sterling Monetary Framework (SMF) and lead on the Bank balance sheet’s transition into a new operating framework – a repo-led, demand-driven system for supplying central bank reserves.
All of our standing SMF facilities are ‘ open for business ’ – as you’d expect from a bank – and should be used by eligible firms for liquidity management. We have also recently expanded our liquidity facilities through the development of the Contingent Non-Bank Financial Institution Repo Facility (CNRF).
Finally, our management of the balance sheet includes advising on the MPC’s Quantitative Tightening (QT) strategy, as well as implementing QT decisions through the design and execution of the sales operations. The QT annual review process for 2025/26 is underway, and we look forward to continuing to engage with market participants in this context.
We learn a lot about market conditions and plumbing through our facilities and operations, which helps inform both policy design and advice across our various remits. We also remain humble about what we know and may not know and are closely monitoring financial markets signals and feedback, particularly during this period of balance sheet transition.
If our Sterling Markets Division is a bank, then our Foreign Exchange Division (FED) effectively runs like an asset manager. We are responsible for managing the UK’s $203 billion footnote  of official gold and foreign currency reserves on behalf of His Majesty’s Treasury, through the Exchange Equalisation Account (EEA). The primary aim is to ensure the EEA can meet its policy objectives of enabling payments abroad, meeting the UK’s IMF obligations and managing any undue fluctuations in sterling.
We also run the Bank’s own $38 billion pool of FX reserves; carry out wholesale foreign currency transactions on behalf of government departments; provide treasury solutions to other central banks, across many currencies; and we are an active issuer in global Commercial Paper and bond markets.
Strict information segregation is kept between our policy and trading operations, but our presence in markets provides us with important first-hand information about global rates and FX market liquidity, funding and trading conditions in real time. This can be very valuable, particularly in periods of market volatility or stress.
How Market Intelligence feeds into our Policy Committees
So how does our understanding of financial markets, and particularly our market intelligence (MI) gathering, feed into our policy committee deliberations?
Our MI and analysis are an important input into the Financial Policy Committee’s (FPC’s) work to identify, monitor and address systemic risks to UK financial stability. Here the focus is less about understanding market expectations of policy decisions or communications. It is more about identifying and monitoring structural changes and vulnerabilities in the financial system better, particularly in areas where data are less readily available, or where activities are taking place outside the regulatory perimeter (Figure 4).
For example, MI has helped the FPC better understand both the benefits and vulnerabilities of market-based finance – as highlighted by the Governor in a recent speech. Last year’s system-wide exploratory scenario (SWES), an innovative way of working collaboratively with market participants to strengthen the Bank’s surveillance and scenario capability, also benefited from MI. We are actively monitoring structural changes in the UK rates market and what implications that may have. This includes identifying possible reforms to market structure to enhance gilt repo market resilience . And we are working closely with colleagues in our Financial Stability area on questions around how current global uncertainty and changes in market correlations can feed through to systemic vulnerabilities.
Our MI framework really shows its worth when we need to understand and react to market dynamics quickly in periods of financial stress and/or volatility. In fact, MI – coupled with our highly experienced staff’s judgements about market conditions and implications – have informed discussions and decisions by our Governors and policy committees many times over the past few years, not least during the 2022 financial stability intervention following the LDI stress. footnote
Figure 4: How does the Markets Directorate support the FPC
Our market presence and expertise has fed substantially into the monetary policy process too (Figure 5).
MI is one of many inputs that the MPC considers in its policy deliberations. It fits into our broader response to Dr Ben Bernanke’s review . As the Governor set out in a recent speech , the direction of travel for our monetary policy communication is to move away from communicating through one central projection that reflects the ‘best collective judgement’ of the MPC, and towards explaining how risks, scenarios, and a wider range of analysis inform the policy choice.
Staff-led MI supports this process by overlaying traditional data and models with valuable qualitative insights. Specifically, it helps us decipher the signals markets may be sending us about the outlook, expectations, and the impact of asset prices and financial conditions on the real economy. We also advise colleagues on how communications may be interpreted by market participants.
We have dedicated teams covering developments in UK rates markets and monetary policy expectations. They speak with market participants on a regular basis, to get their views on the economy and test whether the MPC’s reaction function is well understood This is supplemented by the Market Participants Survey (MaPS) , which is used to provide a time series of quantitative, repeatable and highly representative aggregated MI from participants in UK rates markets to the MPC.
My colleagues and I brief the Committee regularly on what we hear and see, on an aggregated basis and considering many points of view. We provide our informed judgements and analysis on what this may mean for policy decisions and communications. This is – crucially – not because the MPC should mechanically follow what markets expect. Rather because understanding it forms part of the inputs necessary for the Committee’s decisions. Market expectations of the future path of Bank Rate affects the longer-term interest rates that UK households and firms face, as well as the prices of other UK assets, the level of economic activity, and, ultimately, inflation. The signals and feedback we get from financial markets can also bring an interesting – and valuable – layer of challenge to the MPC’s own assessments about the UK’s outlook and global context.
Figure 5: How does the Markets Directorate support the MPC
We are continually seeking to enhance our market intelligence capabilities to ensure they provide even stronger support for monetary policy and the decisions of the MPC.
Introducing the new Market Participants Group
It is in that spirt that we are creating the Market Participants Group (MPG).
There are three main objectives of the MPG.
First, to enable MPC members to hear directly from market participants on a regular basis, aligning the Bank with international peers who have similar groups (such as the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve Bank of New York ). Our staff-led MI provides policymakers with regular synthesised summaries of our MI conversations and quantitative analysis. This will remain the primary source of market-related information for the MPC.
Second, to support the Monetary Policy Transformation Programme we are undertaking and discussing at this conference. As set out in Clare Lombardelli’s speech last year, a culture of ‘continuous learning’ is a cornerstone of our response to Dr Bernanke’s review. We recognise that effective policymaking doesn’t happen in isolation. It requires us to look outward, to engage with experts and draw on the wealth of knowledge that exists beyond the walls of the Bank.
Third, to provide a structured and transparent framework for MPC members’ direct interaction with market contacts. This interaction will ensure that all MPC members have access to the same information and views at the same time. MPC members will ask questions but will be in listening mode, without communicating any information that is not already in the public domain, including about their own policy stance. Minutes of these meetings will be published so that the information will be available to all.
Shortly after this speech, we will be opening the applications process. We will select a pool of up to 16 MPG market participant members, from both buy- and sell-side firms to deliver sufficiently broad coverage across firm type and individual expertise. Members will be senior contacts from large and active firms in UK and global markets, with a broad and deep financial market expertise. Membership is conferred on individuals not institutions, but we will keep institutions in mind when looking at overall membership. Aligned with our Meeting Varied People strategy, we will be looking to appoint members of the MPG from diverse backgrounds to represent diversity of thought in the views we collect. Half of the selected members will be rotated every two years, with the remainder providing continuity to the group. The list of MPG members will be published on our website. And we will continue to regularly engage with a broad swathe of market participants through our staff-led MI function.
I would strongly encourage people in relevant roles to apply and be a part of this landmark way for the MPC to engage externally. Selection criteria and the application form are available on the Bank’s website. Applications will open from today until 25 July. We will announce the first cohort of MPG members in Q3.
The first MPG meeting will take place in November. We will also review the MPG approach over time and may want to make changes as we see how it operates in practice.
Table A: The Market Participants Group (MPG)
The MPG will be a senior-level forum for financial market participants in the UK to share their views on relevant themes and narratives in financial markets with members of Monetary Policy Committee.
How it will work:
3–4 meetings a year.
Chaired by the Governor of the Bank of England.
Up to 18 financial market participant members from large and active firms in UK and global markets. 6-8 will join each meeting.
Membership is conferred on individuals not institutions, but we will keep institutions in mind when looking at overall membership.
Members will be appointed for a minimum of 2 years, with 50% rotated in year 3.
The first meeting will take place in November.
Agenda published in advance, on MPC related topics.
Summary minutes published at 7.30am the day after the meeting.
Application criteria and form are available on the Bank’s website until 25 July.
Conclusion
To conclude, a reflection: when I was moving to the Bank, someone told me that it might be easier to help make policy than to try to forecast it. After helping our Committees and Executive navigate a global pandemic, an energy shock, a financial stability intervention, bank failures, a trade shock, a monetary policy tightening cycle and a loosening cycle, all amidst persistent uncertainty and market volatility – I’m not quite so sure.
What I am sure of is the importance of our policymakers and markets understanding each other as best as possible, as they both anticipate each other’s reaction functions, particularly in uncertain times. This symbiotic relationship requires, above all, open lines of communication.
Looking ahead, the new Market Participants Group will become an important forum for the MPC to hear directly from those at the forefront of financial markets, to complement the significant market context that they already get from staff. It will be a key feature of our enhanced approach to policymaking, ensuring a robust framework around the MPC’s engagement with external participants.
I would like, once again, to strongly encourage those in relevant roles to apply, and look forward to putting this exciting innovation into practice over the coming months.
I would like to thank Geoff Coppins, Bianca Ginelli Nardi, Sarah Illingworth, Manon Laffly and Charlotte McEwan for their help in drafting this speech, and Andrew Bailey, Sarah Breeden, Iain de Weymarn, Michael Foster, Sumita Ghosh, Mike Goldby, Tom Jennings, Phillipe Lintern, Clare Lombardelli, Catherine Mann, Arif Merali, Huw Pill, John Power, Dave Ramsden, Matt Roberts-Sklar, Victoria Saporta, and Tom Smith for their helpful comments and suggestions.

A feature not a bug − speech by Megan Greene
In this speech, Megan Greene explores how the Bank of England, ECB and Federal Reserve are managing their balance sheets; whether this creates trading opportunities in financial markets; and if this has an impact on monetary policy implementation. She finishes by setting out her views on the outlook for policy.

Revisiting the Norman Conquest of $4.86. Thoughts for the world today - speech by Andrew Bailey
Speech
It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to open this conference.  You could say that it is an example of the endearing British sense of humour that we organise a conference on what is commonly regarded as one of the less good economic decisions in the country’s history.  You may add that what I have just said demonstrates another British characteristic, the calculated British sense of understatement. Actually, as I hope to show, there remain lessons to be learned from the events. And, I do follow the wise advice of Ken Arrow, that “It will always be true that practical understanding of the present will require knowledge of the past.” footnote
Two other things before I get properly started. First, my title is unashamedly a lift from the sub-title of Donald Moggridge’s book on British monetary policy in the period footnote  , which – as Adam Tooze has recently commented – is one of the best such sub-titles.  On this, can I also say how nice it is that Susan will participate in the panel session today. It wouldn’t be the same if we could not personally record the major contribution of Susan and Don in this field.  And, it is of course sad that Don isn’t with us.
The second point is to mention something that I find amusing about the events around the return to gold.  Montagu Norman kept a diary, which is available on-line on the Bank’s website. On the day it was announced by Winston Churchill at 4.30pm in the House of Commons, Norman wrote in large capitals in his diary, “GOLD STANDARD”. In this day and age, I think we can describe it as putting the caps lock on and going full Trump.
On to more serious stuff. I am not going to give a full account of the events of 1925, I am going to be selective to illustrate a few points. One way to look at the episode is as a clash between domestic and international priorities. Norman took an international view – I will come on to describe it more fully. His biographer Andrew Boyle commented that he ardently believed that Europe could only begin to count on lasting peace and prosperity once Britain reinstated the gold standard footnote  .
In contrast, Don concluded forcefully that Norman failed to understand the domestic context, and showed very little apparent interest in doing so. The wild card in this is the position of Keynes. I will come onto this, but I do think the most pithy observation here came from Don when he observed that over time Keynes advocated almost every possible form of exchange rate arrangement.
I am going to set out very briefly, and rather selectively, some of the arguments on the international versus domestic cases, and then use these to draw out a few points that I think are of relevance today.
There are a number of strands to the international argument, but they come together in the conviction that the gold standard was the best form of monetary anchor at the time, that it was an open economy anchor in the sense that it had anchored across countries in a world of large capital and trade flows, and that in doing so before the First World War it had worked. It provided certainty on the terms of international trade and thus lowered transaction costs. Douglas Irwin has concluded that studies have attributed up to 20% of the growth of world trade between 1880 and 1910 to the benefits of greater certainty and lower transactions costs footnote  . Allied to this is the argument that before the First World War adherence to the gold standard was an effective signal of credibility which had beneficial consequences for a country’s external borrowing cost. Estimates put this benefit as up to 30 basis points footnote  .
I would add two further elements of the broad international argument for returning at the pre-war parity. The first is the view that the experience of hyper-inflation in a number of European economies after the First World War heightened the attraction of sticking to the pre-war anchor. The second is that returning to gold at the established parity, and lowering transactions costs by doing so, would benefit the City of London as a financial centre, and most particularly if the UK led the way in doing so.
The problem was of course that by returning in this way the burden of adjustment fell on domestic wages and prices. These had been sufficiently flexible in the late nineteenth century, but in the face of smaller economic shocks than were to emerge after 1925.
But at the pre-war parity sterling was overvalued – domestic prices were now higher relative to other countries.  This was the essence of the Keynes critique, namely that a central bank with the objective of fixing the value of its currency in terms of gold could not use monetary policy to stabilise domestic prices, which should be the objective footnote  . In stable times, the gold standard worked because there was no conflict between a fixed exchange rate and stable domestic prices.  But that was not the case when the economic shocks were larger, and because domestic prices were relatively higher the impact was to force deflation.  We can add to this that in terms of the impact on borrowing costs noted earlier, the actual evidence suggests that while countries returning to gold at pre-war parities did lower their costs of borrowing, those who devalued on return gained somewhat more, though the evidence is open to some interpretation footnote  .
A further problem that was revealed by the larger shocks that occurred after return concerned the asymmetry of adjustment.  The gold standard did not provide an explicit  remit for monetary policy.  It was supposed to work on the basis of the price-specie flow mechanism set out by David Hume, where gold flows were determined by monetary conditions, backed up by central banks following the “rules of the game”, with appropriate interest rate and balance sheet policies.   In this way, prices would adjust to restore Balance of Payments equilibrium.  Whether central banks always followed those rules in the pre-1914 gold standard is debated, but the system seemed to work, at least in in times of smaller shocks.  But with the larger shocks of the late 1920s and 1930s, deviating from those rules mattered.  The surplus countries (France and the US) sterilised gold inflows and thus prevented the equilibrating mechanism through domestic price adjustment.  Irwin estimates that between 1928 and 1930, the US and France demonetised 11% of the world’s gold stock, thereby contributing to further deflation footnote  .
Before concluding on the relevance for today, I want to draw out a further point.  As I noted earlier, it is quite hard to pin down exactly what exchange rate regime Keynes did prefer, as distinct from the ones he did not like.  As Irwin notes, by 1925 he was certainly an opponent of the return to the pre-War parity under the gold standard.
But he favoured exchange rate stability and was sceptical that flexible exchange rates could solve Balance of Payments problems footnote  .  He appreciated therefore that by preferring domestic employment goals and exchange rate management, he was ruling out open capital flows.  This put him at odds with Norman.  In fact, James Meade - the subject of a new biography by Susan footnote  - was one of the few economists of the period whose views were more aligned to the modern preference of free floating exchange rates, free trade and domestic monetary policy goals.
Turning to the relevance of 1925 for today’s issues, I want to finish by drawing out three points where there are interesting parallels.
The first concerns the robustness of monetary regimes.  The gold standard stood up to the test of the shocks of the nineteenth century, but did not stand up to the much larger shocks of the inter-war period, and particularly the late 1920s and 1930s.  Our regime today, based on the nominal anchor of the domestic inflation target, was developed over the decade or so before the financial crisis.  In contrast to the gold standard, I think that it has stood up well to the larger shocks of recent years starting with the financial crisis.  Our judgement to date is that it has contributed well to reducing inflation persistence following the shocks of recent years.
The second point is closely related.  Some countries went back onto gold and introduced flexibility by adjusting their parities from the pre-war level.  As I described earlier, this was not the UK approach, and not only was this Norman’s strong preference, but returning at the pre-war parity was the conclusion of both committees set up to examine the issue, starting with the Cunliffe Committee of 1918.  In the well-known words of former Chancellor Reginald McKenna to Churchill: “There is no escape, you have to go back, but it will be hell”.  For Churchill, it was a matter of “Shackling ourselves to reality” footnote  .    But this begs the question, how much flexibility can be included in an anchor without compromising it?
More recent UK history is interesting here.  In the days immediately pre-Bank independence, the UK started with an inflation target range, and then switched to a point target.
This strikes me as a sensible limitation of flexibility to promote the credibility of the target.  But after the financial crisis and the following recession, the target regime was modified to allow more flexibility in the pace of return to target where there are so-called trade-off conditions between activity and inflation.  This “constrained discretion” is limited but useful flexibility.  The appropriateness of flexibility therefore remains an important judgement.
The third point concerns international adjustment under the gold standard, and, as I noted earlier, the asymmetry between surplus and deficit countries when it came to so-called equilibrating gold flows.
This meant that surplus countries had the incentive and the ability to put more of the adjustment burden onto the deficit countries, as was the case with France and the US.  The adjustment asymmetry point was subsequently built into the Bretton Woods regime.  Today, we have another version of this issue when we look at the US-China trade position and the associated imbalances.  The asymmetry may not be the same, or indeed present even, but it is reasonable to believe that it might be a feature.
To end, all of this reinforces for me the benefits of going back to review the 1925 decision – there is much to study and learn.
Thank you.

Navigating an uncertain outlook: the signals from the labour market − speech by Dave Ramsden
Speech
Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Barclays-CEPR Monetary Policy Forum, which gives me the opportunity to set out my latest thinking, in the light of last week’s decision by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The MPC decided by a majority of 6-3 to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 4.25%, and I was one of the three members who preferred to cut Bank Rate by 25bps.
Over the last eight meetings, a year in MPC terms, we have gradually eased policy restrictiveness in the UK, cutting Bank Rate four times, reflecting the progress made in the disinflation process to bring inflation back towards the 2% target sustainably in the medium term.

Bank Rate, CPI and core inflation (a)
Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Core inflation is defined as CPI excluding food, beverages, tobacco and energy. CPI and core inflation data to May 2025, Bank rate to June 2025.
The persistence of domestic inflationary pressures has been our key focus and we have taken a gradual approach to reducing policy restraint to ensure persistent inflationary pressures in domestic wage and price-setting are squeezed out so that inflation returns sustainably to the 2% target. Since the start of this year we have stressed that we are taking a ‘gradual and careful’ approach in light of the increasingly uncertain global and domestic environment, which is leading to two-sided risks to the outlook for inflation. footnote
Today I want to set out how my thinking has evolved, building on a speech I gave in South Africa in February. footnote  I’m going to focus on the labour market, since, notwithstanding all the global events, that is where I judge the most material developments have been in recent months.
Although the MPC’s focus on uncertainty has increased recently, uncertainty is not a recent phenomenon. Chart 2 shows that the Bank’s in-house uncertainty index, as measured by the nine indicators which make up the index, has yo-yoed over the last ten years in response to a series of shocks starting with Brexit. It has picked up sharply again in the last year, driven in the most recent episode by trade policy uncertainty.

Sources: Baker et al (2016) , Bloomberg Finance L.P., Caldara et al (2019) , CBI, Consensus Economics, GfK, ICE Data Services, LSEG, S&P Global, and Bank calculations. (a) The UK uncertainty index is calculated as the first principal component of nine proxies of economic uncertainty, based on data starting in 1985. See Box A of the May 2025 MPR for further detail on the proxies. The final data points are to May 2025.
Uncertainty is typically thought of as widening the probability distribution of future events, making it harder to forecast what will happen next. More recently unpredictability has entered the MPC’s lexicon to refer to events that are unforecastable based on past experience. The MPC has employed the term with regard to the recent shocks to the outlook for the global trading system. There is lots of empirical evidence showing how challenging shocks and the resulting uncertainty (and unpredictability) are for businesses and households.
Increasing uncertainty and unpredictability is a key driver for the Bank for progressing its response to the Bernanke review; enhancing our forecasting infrastructure and toolkit and building out scenarios to illustrate the mechanisms at work and the risks around those is of even greater importance. In particular the extent to which demand or supply weakness is impacting the UK economy as these can have different consequences for the extent and nature of inflationary pressures. Scenarios help to test the robustness of policy decisions, helping us to arrive at policy which will be robust to a range of alternative plausible futures for the economy.
Developments in the UK economy …
Notwithstanding the prevailing uncertainty and the unpredictability of events, the main aggregates in the MPC’s baseline forecast for GDP, inflation, unemployment and spare capacity have not changed much so far this year, as shown in Table 1.

The main features of the outlook are common to both our February and May MPR baseline forecasts. Underlying growth in GDP is forecast to continue to be weak, in part because of restrictive monetary policy. GDP growth from 2025 Q2 onwards is projected to be much weaker than the headline numbers for Q1 where there is clear evidence of front-loading of activity in response to the threat of tariffs.
The MPC is forecasting a hump in inflation for the remainder of this year which is in part due to past energy price rises and a number of one-off increases in administered prices. Because of weak growth in demand – relative to estimated supply growth – a margin of spare capacity (excess supply or a negative output gap) opens up over the forecast supporting the disinflationary process. A gradual fall in headline inflation is projected through 2026 with inflation returning to the 2% target in early 2027. Unemployment rises to around 5% over the forecast period.
We will publish updated baseline forecasts in August, which will also have to take account of the rapidly moving geopolitical developments in the Middle East.
…with a focus on the labour market
Given the relative stability in the baseline forecast what is it about the outlook that has influenced my thinking? The short answer is the cumulative evidence of a continued material loosening in the labour market. As a result while I still think the risks to inflation continue to be two-sided I’m now attaching more weight to the downside risks in the medium term.
Assessing the state of the labour market has been challenging in recent years. This is in part due to issues with the official Labour Force Survey (LFS) series but also because some of the apparent trends, for example in the decline in participation and, more recently, the strength in the official earnings series have been very difficult to explain based on past experience. As a consequence, we have increasingly examined the trends in a wide range of labour market indicators. And I want to use the next section of my remarks to set out my latest assessment in three parts – first what we are seeing in terms of labour market quantities, second what we can glean from flows data, and third what is happening on the nominal side of the labour market.
The vacancies to unemployment (V/U) ratio has become our primary indicator of conditions in the labour market. As shown in Chart 3, the V/U ratio has come down significantly from its peak in mid-2022, with the majority of the move coming from falls in vacancies. We tend to use 2019 as a comparison point for the state of the labour market, given domestic demand and supply were seen to be broadly in balance, and relative to that pre-Covid reference point the V/U ratio is now materially lower.
Chart 3: The V/U ratio continues to decline
Vacancies to unemployment ratio and estimated equilibrium values (a)
Sources: AA/WARC Expenditure Report, ONS and Bank calculations.(a) The equilibrium V/U ratio is estimated using an error-correction model over the period 1982–2024. The real cost of vacancy posting and hourly labour productivity are included as long-run determinants for the level of vacancies. The model also includes controls for short-term movements in these variables ( Stelmach et al, 2025 ). The final data points for both series in the chart are 2025 Q1, while diamonds represent projections for 2025 Q2.
As vacancies have exhibited an upward trend over time Bank staff have estimated an equilibrium V/U ratio, also shown on Chart 3. The difference between the observed and equilibrium V/U ratio – the V/U gap – gives a measure of the degree of slack in the labour market. In the last couple of years the V/U gap has shown a reasonable correlation with Bank staff’s estimate of the output gap, as shown in Chart 4. On that basis, the V/U gap suggests that a degree of economy-wide slack has now opened up.

This loosening is also increasingly apparent from the employment numbers. The latest PAYE data for payrolled employees, notwithstanding the potential for revisions, indicate that private sector employee numbers are now clearly in contractionary territory, as shown in Chart 5. Growth rates in the public sector are also falling back. Retail and hospitality, the sectors particularly impacted by the National Living Wage (NLW) and National Insurance Contributions (NICs) increases in April 2025, have fallen particularly sharply. Notwithstanding these early indications it will be some time before we can be more certain about how NLW and NICs increases will feed through into firms’ hiring decisions, versus being passed on to consumers in price increases, or reduced wage growth or simply absorbed into firms’ profit margins.

The Bank Agents’ measure of recruitment difficulties and the REC survey, which has been a pretty reliable leading indicator of the V/U ratio, points to some further loosening in the pipeline, as shown in Chart 6.

It is important to stress that what we are seeing in terms of the outlook is a sustained cumulative loosening rather than a more abrupt weakening. The redundancy rate and notifications have picked up only very gradually and remain at a very low rate, though the notifications series shown in the left hand panel of Chart 7 does not cover the smallest businesses. A potential leading indicator of a more material increase ahead is the rise in Google searches for redundancy, shown in the right-hand panel of Chart 7.

Measures of redundancies (a)(b)
Sources: Insolvency Service Redundancy Payment Services Database, Google Trends, ONS and Bank calculations.(a) Employers are required to submit an HR1 form at least 30 days before the first dismissal where 20 to 99 redundancies are proposed, and at least 45 days before the first dismissal where 100 or more redundancies are proposed.(b) Google searches show the seasonally adjusted average of trends for the terms: ‘redundancies’, ‘redundancy calculator’, and ‘redundancy insurance’.
Turning to the LFS based flows data I’d like to start by recognising the ONS’ efforts in re-introducing these data series, which help inform understanding of labour market dynamics. Although it is important to acknowledge that the relatively low sample sizes, while rising, mean we shouldn’t over-interpret what we take from these data.
With that said, I’d like to draw out what signal we can take from the inflows to unemployment, the ‘separation rate’ and the outflows from unemployment, the ‘job-finding’ rate. Typically, at the start of a more pronounced downturn there would be an uptick in the separation rate, as workers become unemployed. In parallel outflows from unemployment typically tick down slightly from the start of a downturn. Chart 8, with the job-finding rate inverted, suggests initial signs of that process re-emerging over the last year.
Chart 8: LFS based flows data suggest more loosening to come?
Cumulative changes in the flows-consistent 16-64 unemployment rate
Sources: ONS Labour Force Survey and Bank calculations.
If the recent trends in flows persist then we may see signs of a more substantial weakening in the labour market emerging, which would risk unemployment rising more over the next year than in the MPC’s baseline forecast.
What are the implications for the nominal side? The private sector regular Annual Weekly Earnings (AWE) data does continue to be volatile, but the April reading of 5.1% was below our recent forecasts, as shown in Chart 9.
Chart 9: Developments in wages are on track
Short-term projections of annual private sector wage growth (a)(b)
Sources: Bank of England Agents, DMP Survey, HMRC, KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs, Lloyds Business Barometer, ONS and Bank calculations.(a) Private sector regular pay growth in the aqua line shows the ONS measure of private sector regular average weekly earnings growth (three-month average on same three-month average a year ago). Bank staff’s indicator-based model of near-term private sector regular pay growth is quarterly and uses mixed-data sampling (or MIDAS) techniques. Latest data points are for the three months to April 2025 for private sector regular pay and 2025 Q2 for the indicator-based model estimates.(b) Diamonds indicate projections or expectations for pay growth. Definitions of wage growth vary between each of the measures. The Agents’ pay survey diamond shows respondents’ expected average pay settlements in 2025, weighted by employment and sector. The DMP diamond shows average expected pay growth one year ahead for respondents to the May 2025 DMP Survey. Feb MPR pay growth projections are for 2024 Q4 to 2025 Q4, May MPR pay growth projections are for 2025 Q1 to 2026 Q1.
This follows the concerning pick-up in AWE growth rates in the second half of last year. Our indicator-based model estimates didn’t take too much of a signal from the pick-up but the previous downward trend in wages did level off. Given these uncertainties the MPC anchored its expectations for earnings to the Bank’s agents pay survey, which has had a good recent track record of predicting actual pay settlements. The survey was consistent with settlements falling from 5.4% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025, which would be approaching rates consistent with the MPC’s inflation target. footnote  The latest intelligence from the Agents had continued to suggest average pay settlements for 2025 of 3.5% to 4%. Further encouragement comes from the Bank’s and Brightmine’s settlements databases, which point to actual settlements since the start of the year in a range of 3% to 4%, although the sample is still partial at this stage.
Developments in inflation
Headline CPI increased to 3.4% in May from 2.6% in March, so we are now seeing the hump in inflation that we had been expecting. The headline CPI number was in line with our short-term forecast for 3.4% in Q2. This shows inflation peaking at 3.7% in September before easing back to around its current level by the end of the year. The main components of inflation are on different paths, as set out in Chart 10.
I have previously drawn attention to the extent to which we can draw conclusions from these components, footnote  noting that the degree of symmetry in the respective rise and fall of each wave gives a gauge on the extent of inflation persistence. The key services ex. rents disinflation process is now clearly slower than its earlier inflationary rise and at 4.4% is uncomfortably high. It will stay elevated in the short term due in large part to the effects of various administered and one-off price increases. But given the high labour intensity of services the increasing evidence of a loosening in the labour market should continue to provide a disinflationary impulse.
Turning to the other components of the CPI, rent inflation, having stayed stubbornly high, has finally started to fall relatively steeply.

Inflation rates of the components of CPI inflation
Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. Data to May 2025.
At the same time what is clearly evident from Chart 10 is the pick-up in food price inflation from the middle of last year. At 4.4% in May it was above our forecast and the level of food prices is now 36% above its level four years ago in spring 2021. This is significant because there is some evidence that food prices are particularly salient for households’ perceptions of, and expectations for, inflation. footnote
Core goods price inflation has remained subdued, tracking slightly below our short-term forecasts. To complete the picture, even before the latest geopolitical developments, energy price inflation was close to turning positive again in May after the best part of two years in negative territory.
Uncertainty in the outlook – weak demand or weak supply?
When weighing up the risks to the inflation outlook as they have evolved in 2025, I’ve focussed on two qualitative scenarios for weak demand and weak supply. To more systematically address the mechanisms underpinning the main risks, Bank staff developed two quantitative scenarios which we included in the May MPR. In the staff’s weaker demand scenario uncertainty played a bigger role than in our baseline forecast, weighing particularly on investment but also on household saving and leading to domestic inflationary pressures fading more quickly. In the weaker supply scenario, the current hump in headline inflation led to additional second round effects and more inflation persistence, underpinned by less loosening in the labour market and amplified by weak potential productivity growth.
More detail on the scenarios can be found in the May MPR footnote  and in speeches from other MPC members. For the purposes of my remarks today the main evolution in my thinking is to put more weight on the mechanisms at play in the weaker demand scenario, which will be reinforced by the risks of a more significant loosening in the labour market.
I remain alive to the risk that we will not see the recovery in productivity envisaged in the MPC’s baseline forecast. And I am not ruling out that the wage setting process has become less flexible, for example through wage setting having become less contestable. Nor am I ruling out that mismatch may have become more pronounced in certain sectors. We will need to stay vigilant about the changing composition of inflation and the risk that rises in the most salient parts of the consumer basket, food and energy, increase the chances of second round effects from the current hump in headline inflation. Similarly, the MPC needs to pay close attention to any evidence that the later stages of the disinflation process, whereby lower wages growth feeds through into lower services prices growth is stalling.
These are all plausible considerations. But in my assessment of the risks to meeting our inflation target in the medium term they have been outweighed by the cumulative evidence across a wide range of indicators of ongoing labour market loosening.
Implications for monetary policy
In terms of the MPC’s June decision I assessed that the signals from the labour market provided a sufficiently strong case for a reduction in Bank Rate to 4%, to guard against the increasing risk that, in the medium term, inflation would settle at below our 2% target. Given the myriad uncertainties relating to global developments but also the UK outlook any policy approach has to be robust to alternative states of the world.
Before finalising my vote I challenged myself on whether sequential cuts in Bank Rate in May and June would be appropriate if it subsequently became clear that risks to inflation were actually weighted to the upside. It was a finely balanced judgement for me but I concluded that my approach was robust for two main reasons. First because even at 4% I assess that monetary policy would remain clearly in restrictive territory. So if evidence emerged that pointed to higher inflation in the medium term then Bank Rate could be held higher for longer than would otherwise be the case. Second given the environment we are operating in I think it is important that monetary policy is outlook dependent and should respond and be seen to respond when the evidence on the outlook requires it. I continue to take a watchful and responsive approach to setting policy. I think this is in line with the emphasis the MPC puts in its collective communications on policy not being on a pre-set path and that we will consider the degree of restraint which is required from meeting to meeting.
I see no inconsistency with my latest vote and the MPC’s gradual and careful approach to the withdrawal of restrictiveness. This has served the MPC well over the last year as we have cut Bank Rate four times by a total of 100bps in total. And I believe it will continue to serve us well in these times of increased uncertainty and unpredictability, as long as the disinflation process is judged to be continuing, in order to return inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term.

As noted in the May 2025 MPR there is tentative evidence that households’ inflation expectations have become more sensitive to price changes since the most recent period of very high inflation. That is consistent with estimates by Anesti et al (2025) , which suggest that households’ inflation expectations tend to be more sensitive to price changes, specifically changes in food prices, following larger increases in inflation.

Back to the Future 2: Keeping inflation close to the 2% target − speech by Dave Ramsden | Bank of England
See What if things are different? - speech by Clare Lombardelli | Bank of England . Simple ready-reckoners suggest that wage growth around 3% and potentially a bit higher would be consistent with inflation at target.
Surveys, forecasts and scenarios: setting UK monetary policy under uncertainty − speech by Dave Ramsden | Bank of England
The number of times we’ve used ‘uncertain’ or ‘uncertainty’ in the Bank’s Monetary Policy Reports (MPR) has increased from 20 times in the August 2024 MPR, to 43 in the November 2024 MPR, 59 in the February 2025 MPR and 112 times in the May 2025 MPR.

The UK economy in an unpredictable world – speech by Andrew Bailey
In this speech, Andrew Bailey discusses the outlook for the UK economy in an unpredictable world.  He explains why a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate.
Speech
There is a lot going on in the world around us.  Escalation of the conflict in the Middle East drove up energy prices in the past few weeks but in the last few days they have come back down again.  Global trade policies remain unpredictable.  These are things that weigh on the global economy.
Elevated global uncertainty affects UK businesses too.  We have heard that clearly through the Bank’s Agents – and I have heard it when I talk to business leaders from across the country.  Expectations for export sales have softened, investment decisions have been delayed, and supply chains adjusted – though on investment the messages delivered by the Prime Minister from this stage a few hours ago are positive and welcome news.
While I am on the subject of world developments, I visited Kyiv last Friday at the invitation of the Ukrainian National Bank.  The experience was humbling.  The moral case is      clear: as a nation, Ukraine has the right to determine its own future.  And that is what Russia does not accept.  I strongly agree with successive UK Governments that we must give our full support to Ukraine on this.  The strands of history run deep here, and it is our security that is at stake too.  The moral argument is unassailable.
But there is more to the story for the UK economy then global events, and for the    Monetary Policy Committee’s decisions on interest rates.  It is the wider developments in the domestic UK economy that matter, and that is what I will focus on today.
I will start with some background of relevance for the theme of this conference, before turning to the outlook for activity, inflation and monetary policy.
That background, I’m afraid, is one of slowing potential growth in the UK economy in recent decades. By Bank staff estimates, average annual growth rates in potential supply in the UK economy was above 2½% in the years from 1990 and up to the global financial crisis.  In the decade after the financial crisis, it halved to around 1¼%.  This is not a very good start to the story, although of course history does not dictate what happens in the future.
Slower potential supply growth reduces the rate at which economic activity can expand without generating inflationary pressures.  Monetary policy has to respect this constraint; a temptation to boost growth by stimulating demand in an environment where supply is constrained would be both ineffective and counterproductive.  Achieving price stability,     by contrast, creates the environment that is supportive for sustainable growth.
Raising the potential growth rate of the economy is one of the most important challenges facing us as a society today. footnote  It is the only source of sustainable improvements to the standard of living.  And it is key to addressing other big challenges we face – dealing with an ageing society, enhancing our defence capabilities, and responding to climate change.  To do so we need to harness new technologies, invest in new skills in the labour force and build new trading relationships with the outside world.
Artificial Intelligence has the potential to be the next General Purpose Technology – like for example electricity before it – and could catalyse innovation and growth across the economy.  That is an opportunity we must not miss.
Innovative and outward-looking UK businesses are essential to those efforts.   After all, that is where the growth will come from.  I am encouraged by the entrepreneurial spirit I meet as I travel with the Bank’s Agents to visit companies and talk to business leaders.  You never quite know what to expect on these visits, whether it is AI-supported street sweepers, quantum computing in space, or a business idea that appealed to me – how to get bikes onto the top of cars more easily to transport them.  And it is encouraging to see business leaders from across the UK come together at this conference to seek practical, forward-looking solutions.  I would like to thank you, Shevaun, and the British Chambers of Commerce for the leadership you provide.
Growth also requires strong institutions and public policies to provide a supportive environment.  I welcome the Government’s strong commitment to growth and its initiatives to strengthen the UK’s relations to our trade partners.  The Prime Minister’s messages this morning were very positive and welcome news, setting out a course that can unleash further investments that will make a real difference to the UK economy.
The Bank of England has a role to play too, with our strong commitment to monetary and financial stability.  These are important foundations for growth and prosperity.
So let me turn to the outlook for activity, inflation and monetary policy as we see it today.
The UK economy grew by 1.1% in 2024 when compared to 2023 overall, and by 1.5% when comparing the fourth quarter of 2024 with the fourth quarter of 2023.  And while growth was weak in the second half of last year, it had a strong start to 2025 with 0.7% quarterly growth reported for the first quarter in the ONS’s First Estimate.  This is a bit stronger than we had expected in our May Monetary Policy Report – and by itself would raise the prospect that growth could turn out a bit stronger than we had been expecting in the second quarter too.  So far so good.
But there are a couple of reasons why we think the UK economy will grow at a more moderate pace over the coming quarters.
First, the unexpected strength in the first quarter was driven by strong outcomes for volatile components of GDP in the monthly figures for March.  This was possibly a result of front-loading of activity ahead of increases in Stamp Duty Land tax and Vehicle Exercise Duty, and with a temporary boost to trade ahead of the imposition of new tariffs on exports to the United States.  Consistent with this, monthly GDP contracted by 0.3% in April.
Second, looking at the expenditure components of GDP, while business investment was strong in the first quarter, businesses tell us that heightened uncertainty and a weak demand outlook are weighing on investment intentions.   That could point to slower investment over coming months – although how it pans out remains to be seen, and again I was encouraged by what the Prime Minister had to say earlier.  And, while real household incomes have risen quite strongly, consumption has not followed suit.  The household savings rate, in other words, has gone up – and to quite a high level compared to past experience.  We have not seen evidence yet to indicate any decline in the saving rate, with the implications that carries for consumption.
We should not be too surprised about this.  Monetary policy remains restrictive to ensure that past inflationary pressures are squeezed out, with higher interest rates incentivising saving over consumption.  And households are likely to smooth through rises in their real incomes following previous increases in the cost of living.  This is consistent with what respondents to our annual household survey have told us.  In our most recent survey from March, 27% say that higher interest rates was a reason why they had saved more than usual over the past year, and just over one-third reported having rebuilt their buffer of savings for a rainy day.
The labour market has been very tight in the past few years.  But we are now seeing signs that conditions are easing.  Employment growth is subdued, and several indicators of labour demand and hiring intentions have softened.  Real time data from HMRC suggest that the number of payrolled employees fell by 0.4% in the three months to May, and have now fallen in each of the last 7 months, with a contraction of more than 100,000 people on the month.  These data are often revised in later vintages, but survey-based measures and intelligence from the Bank’s Agents corroborate the pattern of continued loosening.
That takes me to pay.  We watch this very carefully.  Wage growth remains an important factor behind the remaining persistence in services price inflation in particular.  A sustainable disinflation in the UK economy after the big shocks we have faced relies on a normalisation of wage growth to levels consistent with the 2% inflation target.
This process still has some way to go. Annual private sector regular average weekly earnings (AWE) growth was 5.1% in the three months to April, down from 5.9% in the three months to January, having risen in the second half of last year.  That said, AWE measures are reducing much as we have been expecting, and momentum in the latest data has softened.  The latest data on pay settlements and pay expectations point to a significant decline in wage growth in the year ahead.  The latest intelligence from the Bank’s Agents continue to suggest average pay settlements for 2025 of 3.5 to 4.0%, closer to levels consistent with the inflation target.
What we are ultimately concerned about is the extent to which easing pay pressures feed through to consumer price inflation.  So let me turn to inflation.
Headline CPI inflation fell sharply through 2023 and into 2024, before reaching the 2% target towards the middle of last year.  This year inflation has taken a step up again, to 3.4% in the latest data for May, and we expect it to remain around 3.5% at least into the Autumn before returning to back towards our 2% target next year.
Against the backdrop of a continued gradual easing of price pressures in the UK economy, thanks to the restrictive stance of monetary policy, this increase in CPI inflation has owed largely to increases in energy prices and other regulated and administered prices, such as water bills and Vehicle Excise Duty.  Household energy prices contributed around a quarter of a percentage point to headline CPI inflation in May, and other regulated and administered prices added a little under half a percentage point.
The important point is that these price increases are not directly linked to underlying cost pressures in the UK economy – to the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply – in a way that would clearly require a monetary policy response.  We should not expect them to persist.  And we do not expect that they will rekindle domestic inflationary pressures via new second-round effects as we saw it after the big global shocks that drove inflation up to much higher levels in 2021 and 2022.
A key difference to that episode is that – as I have just described – conditions in the UK labour market are very different now compared to the very tight labour market we had then.
But we should recognise that this short-term pick-up in inflation introduces some further uncertainty into the near-term outlook for inflation.  So we have to monitor very closely how this plays out.  Some of the regulated and administrative prices could change again.  And we have to ensure that second-round effects do not take hold.
Also on our watch list is food price inflation, which has risen materially, from 3.0% to 4.4% in May.  The prices of meat, chocolate and non-alcoholic drinks have gone up the most, consistent with higher wholesale prices for beef, cocoa beans and coffee.  These price increases are to an extent idiosyncratic, with reports of reductions in cattle herds and climate-related disruptions to coffee and cocoa production.  But our Agency intelligence also highlights labour costs and costs related to new packaging regulation as wider factors at play.  And, like energy prices, food prices are salient to consumers.  We have to make sure that these increases do not feed through to second-round effects either.  Although they have fallen back in the latest data, household inflation expectations have been increasing somewhat recently and remain at the upper end of the range that we would normally expect given the level of headline inflation.
As we look ahead, however, it is not least the evolution of services price inflation that will determine headline inflation – and service price inflation, more than goods price inflation, is affected by costs pressures in the UK economy, including pay.  The overall picture here is that services price inflation is coming down gradually.  But services price inflation remains elevated, at 4.7% in the latest data for May.  We need to see disinflation continue – and that easing pay pressures feed through to consumer prices.
I will add a short remark on the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions.  There are a number of ways this increase in the cost of employment could play out: it could be absorbed by firms, either in lower profit margins or through productivity improvements; it could be passed on to customers through higher prices; it could be reflected in lower wages; or it could lead firms to reduce employment.  When we ask businesses, they tend to tick all the boxes.  That is understandable.   Firms’ margins are the first to adjust.  But I am beginning to hear a bit more evidence of adjustments through pay and employment.
With moderate growth and a softer labour market, a wider margin of slack in the UK economy will support continued disinflation in the domestic economy and a gradual return of headline inflation to the 2% target as we look beyond the near-term increase.  In recent months, the evidence that slack is opening up has strengthened, especially in the labour market.  But there remain uncertainties around the overall balance between supply and demand in the economy as well as the remaining inflation persistence in the system.
In the May Monetary Policy Report, we presented two scenarios to illustrate this.  In one scenario, there could be weaker supply and more persistence in domestic wages and prices, including from second-round effects related to the near-term increase in CPI inflation and structural changes in the labour market.  In another scenario, inflationary pressures could ease more quickly owing to greater or longer-lasting weakness in demand relative to supply, in part reflecting uncertainties globally and domestically.  The mechanisms underlying both these scenarios remain relevant to our deliberations on the MPC, set alongside our broader assessment of risks.
And global risks are of course among them, including but not restricted to trade policy.  Global uncertainty remains elevated.  So while the direct impact from trade policies on world output may be smaller than we might have feared, the uncertainty associated with it nevertheless continues to have an impact on the UK economy.  There have been significant moves in the oil price following the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, although not always in the direction we may intuitively have expected.  That only goes to show the unpredictability of events in the world today.
Overall, while the significant progress we have made on disinflation has allowed us to cut Bank Rate, we retain a restrictive monetary policy stance to squeeze out remaining persistence in inflationary pressures.   There remain two-sided risks to inflation.  Given the outlook, and continued disinflation, a gradual and careful approach to the further withdrawal of monetary policy restraint remains appropriate.  Interest rates remain on a gradual downward path.  But monetary policy is not on a pre-set path – and at the June meeting, there was not a strong enough case to cut Bank Rate.
As we meet for our August meeting in a few weeks’ time, we will assess the situation afresh.  Monetary policy needs to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term has dissipated further.
In an unpredictable world, low and stable inflation matters more than ever, because        that – alongside the supportive initiatives being pursued by the Government – enables businesses and households to plan ahead and invest, a key foundation for sustainable growth in the UK economy.
Low and stable inflation is the best contribution monetary policy can make to growth and prosperity in the United Kingdom.
Thank you.

The crucial role of financial stability in a central bank’s policy strategy framework - speech by Randall Kroszner
Randy Kroszner discusses the interactions between financial stability within a central bank’s policy strategy framework and the key elements he believes a robust policy strategy framework needs.
Speech
While I’m absolutely delighted to be invited to speak at this conference, some might question the wisdom of the organizers for inviting me. I joined the Federal Reserve as a Governor in 2006 and the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) soon erupted. I joined as a Member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors only months before the tragedy of 9/11. My ‘brief’ stay in London in late 2019 and 2020 as Deputy Dean of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business to build and open our expanded London campus was significantly prolonged by the outbreak of Covid-19. And Silicon Valley Bank collapsed as I joined the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) in March 2023 for my first set of meetings.
It’s thus with some trepidation that I stand before you this evening to talk about financial stability within the central bank policy framework. “Après moi …”
I’ve witnessed economic and financial shocks since the GFC developments not only as a member of the FPC but also chair of the Federal Research Advisory Committee to the Office of Financial Research at the US Treasury for the last seven years as well as a member of the Academic Advisory Committee of the Chicago Fed for the last decade.  More recently, we at the FPC have expressed concerns about the deterioration in the global risk environment and increased uncertainty. footnote
The core theme of my remarks tonight is very simple – almost trivial: central bank policymakers should be actively cognisant of what each other are up to. For example, macroprudential policymakers should care about monetary policy and monetary policymakers should care about financial stability – because an awareness and understanding of one enhances the effectiveness of the other. footnote  Much recent research undergirds this connection, both in theory and empirically and the Bank’s established way of working provides a good example of how this can be implemented in practice. footnote
Before going further – to avoid eye rolling, gasps of “oh no, not again,” and excuses to nap after dinner, I want to be clear that I am not trying to revive the old debate on whether monetary policy should be used for financial stability purposes, bursting bubbles, etc. footnote  Instead, my reasoning builds on the argument that Federal Reserve Chair Powell made last month that a central bank’s policy strategy framework needs to “be robust to a broad range of conditions [and be] robust to a wide range of economic environments and developments”. footnote
The true test of the robustness of any policy strategy framework is how it can provide a useful guidance not only in normal times but times of stress and turbulence.
The GFC, Covid, as well as recent events have underlined the importance of understanding the interaction between the different aspects of a central bank’s policy strategy framework. In a world of greater volatility, more frequent and persistent supply shocks, and increased uncertainty and risks I would argue that it is particularly important financial stability is explicitly and consistently integrated into a central bank’s overall strategy, tools, and communications. As I will argue, such an integration will help ensure the tools are in place to expedite any responses to crises, when they do occur, while also helping to ensure markets can quickly and appropriately understand and interpret crisis responses a central bank has taken and their impact on the macroeconomy.
Given all this, I am pleased to say that the interaction between financial stability and monetary policy strategy is a priority research topic for the Bank of England, with its Agenda for Research over the next three years explicitly stating how “it is important to understand how various central bank policy tools interact to influence the macroeconomic outcomes and financial stability risks”. This is very welcome. footnote
The remainder of my remarks will focus on the elements of how best to incorporate financial stability into a central bank’s policy strategy framework. In a world of new global challenges, I argue that a robust policy framework needs to incorporate three key elements:
Identifying how the central bank will provide liquidity to deal with a wide range of shocks;
Undertaking stress testing and scenario analysis to understand how shocks affect the effectiveness of policy transmission; and
Developing a communications strategy that allows for a clear delineation of motivations for financial stability actions.
Before elaborating these elements, I will describe how the economic and financial system has evolved to involve greater financial stability risks and outline a simple framework for understanding the interaction between a central bank’s overall policy strategy and those risks.
I will emphasise how the changing economic and financial environment and new insights from research into the interaction between different aspects of a central bank’s policy strategy framework provide the foundation for the three elements of a robust central bank policy framework.
As Sarah Breeden has said, monetary policy and financial stability are “two sides of the same coin”, footnote  and I will first consider how the Bank of England has managed (successfully in my view) to operationalise that, as I believe there are helpful lessons to be drawn from its approach.
The Bank was given its specific statutory objective in relation to financial stability following the GFC. The arrangements were modelled on the monetary policy set up, encompassing a primary objective to “protect and enhance” UK financial stability, and a secondary objective to support the government’s economic policy. ( Figure 1 ). The individual objectives of both committees are typically complementary and both ultimately have the aim of underpinning economic growth and prosperity.
Figure 1: The FPC and MPC at the Bank of England

Since the financial stability objective was given to the Bank of England, its interaction with the monetary policy function has evolved. There is actually nothing in the statute itself that explains how the Bank’s responsibilities in relation to monetary policy and financial stability are to interact. But HM Treasury has tended to use its remit letters to emphasise coordination between monetary policy and macroprudential policy. footnote
For example, the most recent MPC remit letter states that: “Circumstances may also arise in which attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target could exacerbate the development of imbalances that the Financial Policy Committee may judge to represent a potential risk to financial stability. The Financial Policy Committee’s macroprudential tools are the first line of defence against such risks, but in these circumstances the Monetary Policy Committee may wish to allow inflation to deviate from the target temporarily, consistent with its need to have regard to the policy actions of the Financial Policy Committee.” footnote
In practical terms, coordination is also facilitated by the overlap of MPC and FPC membership ( Figure 2 ), and the MPC is also expected to “reflect, in any statements on its decisions, the minutes of its meetings and its Monetary Policy Reports, how it has had regard to the policy actions of the FPC”.
Figure 2: Membership of the Bank of England’s Policy Committees

There are several formal and informal arrangements that enable information to flow freely between the two committees. The common chair of the two committees and their overlapping membership helps to ensure an understanding of the key issues one Committee is facing in the discussions of the other, in an informal way. When appropriate, the overlapping members provide live updates during the respective policy rounds.
Members of both Committees have full access to all relevant briefing materials produced by Bank of England staff, for both the MPC and FPC, and it is routine to for them to be invited to attend briefings for the other committee.
The members of the FPC who are not on the MPC also get briefed after each MPC forecast round. This is important, because the FPC uses the MPC’s central projections for macroeconomic variables as the baseline for its own assessment of risks to the financial system stemming from the economic outlook.
Similarly, members of the MPC who are not on the FPC get briefed on the FPC’s discussions. Again, this matters, because the MPC conditions its forecasts on relevant policy actions that the FPC has announced. One channel through which this takes place is through the MPC’s assessment of the cost and availability of credit, and of the impact that changes in the availability of credit have on economic activity and inflation, for example, if the FPC had reduced the UK countercyclical capital buffer to support lending.
There are also joint meetings of shared interest, in order to ensure a shared understanding of the financial system and how it is affecting the economy, in which they can jointly steer the path for staff analysis and long-term research.
As the FPC warned in April, the probability of adverse events, and the potential severity of their impact has risen. footnote  The potential for global economic shocks originating from rising geopolitical risks, trade policy, and global sovereign debt vulnerabilities is front and centre of financial stability policymakers’ minds. The UK Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress (CISS) showed an uptick earlier this year following the US announcement on trade tariffs ( Chart 1 ).

These vulnerabilities could be exacerbated by a reduction in global co-operation in tackling shocks, which could reduce the resilience of the financial system. High public debt levels in major economies could also reduce the capacity of governments to respond to future shocks, while a deterioration in market perceptions around the sustainability of the long-term path of public debt globally may lead to higher rates, increased term premia and market volatility. This arguably means central banks could be on the hook with greater frequency and intensity to respond to challenges in the future.
Running alongside these heightened risks an increasingly global and interconnected financial system, driven by the growth of market-based finance following the global financial crisis as well as, more recently, innovation in technology and artificial intelligence. footnote  These developments are important to the functioning of the economy, and many bring valuable opportunities to all of us. But they can also create new vulnerabilities that if improperly managed, or if managed without accounting for system-wide dynamics, can create spillovers that can negatively impact the real economy. footnote
At the core of a good macroprudential framework is a need for it to work in good times as well as bad. My argument is that in a world where we are already anticipating more frequent and persistent shocks – as the FPC have set out – then any central bank’s overall policy and strategy framework also needs to be robust to the crystallisation of risks and understand what these shocks could mean for monetary policy as well as financial stability.
My view is that it is important to avoid indifference between monetary policy and financial stability, not just because of the implications for financial stability, but rather to ensure the effectiveness of policy transmission more generally. My colleague Sarah Breeden has, for example, described how “an unstable financial system is a problem for monetary policy”. footnote  A monetary policymaker relies on the financial system for monetary policy to transmit through the economy. It therefore needs a functioning banking and financial system, and it needs markets not to be in disarray. footnote  Put simply, a resilient financial system allows monetary policy to do is job.
Impacts on liquidity, as well as interest rates, are key channels through which the decisions of a central bank on both the monetary policy and financial stability side can interact. Temporary and targeted asset purchases in times of stress – like the Bank conducted in 2022, for example, can ease pressure on dealer intermediation, sometimes called the “asset liquidity channel”. But there is a trade-off with respect to this asset liquidity channel as large scale of purchases of relatively safe assets might – in some circumstances – worsen liquidity conditions by reducing the supply of assets available for use as repo collateral (see, for example, Pelizzon et al, 2025 ).” footnote  In addition, as a central bank reduces the size of its balance sheet, a “funding liquidity channel” could arise as financial markets and institutions need to absorb more securities in an environment in which interest rates may be rising. footnote  , footnote  , footnote
The development and growth of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) also may increase the pressure on central banks to act in times of financial stability stress. The liquidity supplied by asset purchases may be particularly important for financial stability in the presence of a large non-bank sector. Vissing-Jorgenson (2021) for example, emphasise how the effectiveness and necessity of large-scale asset purchases in March 2020 was precisely because so many non-banks were involved. footnote  This is where the growth of NBFIs since the global financial crisis is again of particular importance ( Chart 2 ). Jeremy Stein famously said that “monetary policy gets in all the cracks.” In a world where some of the ‘cracks’ – or the fragilities within the financial system – are arguably becoming less visible and more difficult to observe due to the growth of NBFIs, the central banker’s job is potentially more challenging.

And when policymakers do act it will be crucial to draw a distinction between what is a monetary policy action and what has been done on financial stability grounds.
A key example of how this works in practice – which illustrates what I think the Bank of England has got right in this respect – was the LDI episode of Autumn 2022.
When this kicked off, the FPC was briefed on the market dysfunction and noted the risk to financial stability. The Committee recommended that action be taken to address it and welcomed the Bank’s plans for temporary and targeted purchases in the gilt market on financial stability grounds at an urgent pace. footnote  The Bank also took the decision to postpone gilt sales that the MPC had decided to undertake for monetary policy purposes. The MPC was informed of the market operations before they were implemented. The Bank recommenced with the gilt sales associated with quantitative tightening less than a month later.
To me, this sums up the effective way in which the Bank’s arrangements between the FPC and MPC work. Primarily, the purpose of the intervention by the Bank was made clear by the FPC’s recommendation. It was done explicitly on financial stability grounds. In addition, the intervention was designed in a way that was targeted and, very importantly, temporary. Furthermore, in parallel, action was undertaken – overseen by the FPC – to improve the resilience of the LDI funds so that the purchases could cease without further instability. In other words, the purchases were necessary but not sufficient: increased resilience was also needed.
As a result, action to support financial stability was able to be taken in a deliberate manner and then ended cleanly, allowing monetary policy and quantitative tightening to resume. Even though it could have been perceived that both committees were pulling in different directions their goals were complementary and the credibility of each was maintained.
Recent research at the Bank is advancing further our way of thinking about this, specifically how central banks can use surgical interventions to contain shocks and, as a result, better navigate potential trade-offs between policy objectives. Bandera and Stevens (2024), for example, build a theoretical model to replicate the 2022 episode. They find that the Bank of England asset purchases successfully addressed market stress without materially affecting the monetary policy stance, and that the temporary nature of the intervention was key to avoiding monetary policy spillovers. footnote
Given the above, I think there are three key ways in which a central bank’s policy strategy framework should consider both monetary policy and financial stability. The first is that a robust policy strategy framework needs to take into account how the central bank will provide liquidity to deal with a wide range of shocks.
Discussion of how central banks provide liquidity to both the bank and non-bank sector during stress has been a key focus of recent years. footnote  Last year, Governor Andrew Bailey set out the importance of central bank reserves to delivering on the Bank’s mandate of maintaining financial stability and in implementing monetary policy. footnote  As the safest and most liquid of financial assets, central bank reserves act as the ultimate safe asset in the system underpinning settlement between participants.
In the immediate aftermath of the Covid pandemic Andrew Hauser highlighted the need for central bank’s balance sheets to support both monetary and financial stability by ensuring their toolkits are able to help markets function “well and safely.” footnote  Since then the
market-wide operations and facilities the Bank uses to achieve its monetary policy and financial stability objectives have been evolving. footnote
Table A outlines details of the liquidity facilities offered by the Bank and the Federal Reserve and designed to provide reserves to financial institutions in different circumstances. These can aid in both monetary policy transmission as well as provide liquidity insurance.
One key development in the Bank has been how it provides liquidity to the non-bank sector during stress. Until this year, the Bank provided liquidity to the financial system as a whole via the banking system, under the assumption that banks would onward lend and that liquidity would eventually find its way to the part of the financial system where it was most needed. But when core financial markets are severely dysfunctional, as in 2020, we have seen that banks are not always willing or able to pass on sufficient liquidity sufficiently quickly to NBFIs to meet their demand and avoid a period of financial instability.
The Bank has therefore been working to develop tools to lend to NBFIs directly in times of severe dysfunction in core UK financial markets when financial stability is under threat. The Contingent NBFI Repo Facility (CNRF) was opened for applications in January of this year. The purpose of the CNRF is to address future episodes of severe gilt market dysfunction that threaten UK financial stability arising from shocks that temporarily increase non-banks’ market-wide demand for liquidity. It does so by lending cash against gilts to participating firms, reducing their need to sell assets and thereby supporting the gilt market, the most core of all UK financial markets given its size, interconnectedness and importance to the system and to financial stability. The facility is open to eligible pension funds, insurance companies and liability-driven investment funds. As Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden has previously set out, these sectors are our initial focus given they have both been significant sellers of gilts in past stress episodes and have higher levels of resilience relative to some other NBFIs. footnote  And it will be priced to be expensive when compared to market pricing in normal conditions, but attractive during times of stress.
The CNRF is a contingent facility. It is only available when the Bank judges that gilt market dysfunction is severe enough to threaten financial stability and its lending facilities to banks will not, on their own, eliminate that threat. As Andrew Bailey has previously outlined there is no rationale for standing facilities for non-banks as they do not create money . In contrast, both standing facilities and contingent facilities are available to banks because they do create money, and we need to ensure its singleness (that is the concept that all forms of money have an assured equal nominal value) both in normal times and in times of severe market dysfunction and financial instability. footnote

Federal Reserve
Standing facility
Short-Term Repo: A regular market-wide operation aimed at maintaining control of short-term market interest rates. Provides reserves for a one-week term against high quality collateral at Bank Rate. The STR is intended to be used freely by eligible firms to meet their demand for reserves.
Indexed Long-Term Repo: A regular market-wide operation that provides reserves for a six-month term against a broader range of collateral. Intended to supply the level of reserves necessary to support monetary control and financial stability needs, alongside the STR. The ILTR is intended to be used freely by eligible firms to meet their demand for reserves.
Operational Standing Facilities: On-demand, bilateral facilities. They support firms in managing liquidity demand shocks, such as payment frictions, by allowing participants to borrow reserves against Level A collateral, or deposit reserves, at a fixed spread to Bank Rate. The OSFs also limit volatility in market interest rates by providing an alternative source of borrowing to the Bank’s regular market-wide operations.
Discount window facility: A bilateral on-demand facility, allowing firms to borrow highly liquid assets (gilts and reserves) for an initial term of up to 30-days on demand, against the full range of collateral. The DWF is ‘open for business’ and should be used by SMF participants for the purposes of liquidity management.
Standing Repo Facility: A backstop in money markets to support the effective implementation and transmission of monetary policy and smooth market functioning. Provides short-term liquidity through overnight repo operations with a specified minimum bid rate and aggregate operation limit.
Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility: A supplementary policy tool to help control the federal funds rate and keep it in the target range set by the FOMC.
The Federal Reserve’s discount window: designed to help banks manage their liquidity risks efficiently and avoid actions that can negatively impact their customers, such as withdrawing credit during times of market stress. The discount window comprises of three programs:
Primary Credit: Available to depository institutions that are in generally sound financial condition and granted on a ‘no questions asked’ basis. Currently, the primary-credit rate is set at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. Typically up to 90 days.
Secondary Credit: Short-term liquidity for institutions not eligible for primary credit, usually overnight and at rates above the primary credit rate.
Seasonal Credit: Available to assist small depository institutions in managing seasonal swings in their balance sheets. The rate for seasonal credit is an average of selected market rates.
Contingent
Contingent Term Repo Facility: Activated in response to any actual or prospective market-wide event. Allows the Bank to provide liquidity against the full range of eligible collateral at any time, term, and price.
Contingent Non-Bank Financial Institution Repo Facility (CNRF): Aimed at addressing any future episodes of severe gilt market dysfunction that threaten UK financial stability.  Likely to be used in preference to asset purchases where lending is effective in tackling gilt market dysfunction and when the demand for liquidity is outside the reach of the Bank’s existing Sterling Monetary Framework (SMF) lending facilities. The CNRF will lend cash to participating insurance companies, pension funds and liability-driven investment funds against UK sovereign debt (gilts) for a short lending term.
The second element is that a robust central bank policy framework should recognise the benefits of stress testing and scenario analysis to understand how shocks affect the effectiveness of policy transmission.
The Bank’s approach to stress testing is one which I feel has been mutually beneficial to the FPC, the MPC and indeed the Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC) as well.
The Bank’s bank capital stress test, like others, examines the potential impact of a hypothetical adverse scenario on the health of individual institutions or the system as a whole. In doing so, stress tests allow policymakers to assess resilience to a range of adverse shocks to help ensure the system cannot just withstand those shocks, but also continue to support households and businesses if a stress does materialise.
Between 2017 and 2019, and again in 2022 the Bank’s ACS stress test included a ‘rates up’ scenario, where interest rates were assumed to rise sharply. (As an aside, I would mention how this is in contrast to the Federal Reserve’s approach in the US, where capital stress test scenarios have generally included cuts to interest rates.)
The rich datasets the Bank’s stress tests have generated have allowed policymakers across the Bank – microprudential, macroprudential and monetary policymakers – to better understand the way in which interest rate rises transmit through the financial system.
Indeed, in March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in the US and, in the UK, SVB UK went into resolution. This came at the same time as severe stress at several regional banks in the US and there was the potential for a wider loss of confidence in the global banking system and a tightening in financial conditions, including in the UK. Ahead of the MPC’s policy decision taken on 22 March, the FPC shared its analysis of the developments in the global financial system with the MPC. The FPC made clear that it judged that the UK banking system remained resilient and was well placed to continue supporting the economy in a wide range of economic scenarios, including in a period of higher interest rates.
The FPC was, in part, able to provide this analysis and reassurance to the MPC because of the ongoing work being done over years to understand the potential financial stability risk to the financial system from rising rates.
Stress testing and scenario analysis may also help provide an insight into the dynamics suggested by Acharya and Rajan (2023). This looked at how the Fed’s programme of QE may have driven the growth of deposits, especially uninsured deposits, which helped leave the US financial sector more sensitive to potential liquidity shocks, with lower-capitalised banks most exposed. These liquidity-risk-exposed banks then suffered larger drawdowns and larger stock price declines when the pandemic hit in 2020. footnote
Furthermore, following the Bernanke Review, as the MPC moves towards more scenario analysis, the skills and insights gained from the use of scenarios over recent years – albeit in the FPC’s case to analyse tail risks – are likely to help the committee in its deliberations and the advice staff provide to it. Deputy Governor Clare Lombardelli recently discussed how scenarios can help monetary policymakers consider how the economy may differ from a baseline. footnote
And finally, the Bank’s system-wide exploratory scenario (SWES) the results of which were published last year helped shine a light on how banks would draw on central bank facilities in a stress – either as a precautionary measure or because they assess pricing would be more attractive than the alternatives available in the stress scenario. It also explored how a range of NBFIs would be impacted by a stress and what actions they would take, including how their liquidity would evolve and what actions they would take if faced with shortages. This has provided useful analysis of how banks’ use of the Bank’s lending facilities in such a scenario would be consistent with the design and motivation behind these tools. It has also helped to ensure that the design of the CNRF will allow the Bank to mitigate liquidity shock and address severe gilt market dysfunction in a way that limits the risk to public funds, moral hazard and reduces the possibility of unintended spillovers to monetary policy from financial stability interventions. footnote
The third element is that a robust central bank policy framework should involve a communications strategy that allows for a clear delineation of motivations for financial stability actions.
A major lesson from the LDI episode was the benefit of transparent communication. It was clear that the intervention was done explicitly on financial stability grounds. In addition, the intervention was designed in a way that was targeted and, very importantly, temporary.
The outbreak of Covid in early 2020 also brough forth interventions in response to disruptions in key financial markets. The Fed, for example, made extremely large-scale purchases of the US Treasury securities to reduce the dysfunction in that market where bid-ask spreads widened significantly and liquidity dried up. I believe that the intervention was appropriate and crucial in stabilising the market and restoring liquidity and confidence in the functioning of the market. footnote  A policy strategy framework that allows for a clear distinction between interventions to achieve financial stability goals and monetary policy goals might then have made it more straightforward to communicate that, after the Treasury markets calmed, a reduced pace of asset purchases should not be perceived as tightening of policy. footnote  I was pleased therefore to see Jay Powell note that the Fed’s review will pay particular attention to the changes implemented in 2020, including the way those changes were interpreted by the public and the importance of “clear communications as complex events unfold”. footnote
To further this, it is important to have the framework developed and understood in advance, so that the central bank is not struggling to explain both the complex events and the rationale for why they are taking the steps they are in the midst of a stress event. Pro-actively developing the protocols and framework and articulating that in advance is an important part of effective communication when complex events unfold. In addition, by having worked through various scenarios in advance, it can also expedite the responses by the central bank to a stress event.
It is, I would hope, uncontroversial to say that a central bank’s overall policy strategy framework should take account of financial stability and be robust to a wide range of economic and financial environments and developments. Indeed, financial stability is a pre-requisite for price stability (and vice versa), and together they underpin economic growth and prosperity. footnote
We saw very clearly in the global financial crisis how financial instability can affect the economy directly – it can cause or amplify shocks and lead to loss of jobs, investment and output. That matters to all of us.
Few central banks, however, explicitly and consistently consider how financial stability and monetary policy can interact successfully in practice as part of a central bank’s overall strategy framework, including the interaction between financial stability and the transmission mechanism. I believe the way the Bank of England operates – as I’ve set out – is an effective way to provide a robust policy strategy framework that allows for effective interaction between the FPC and MPC. Although, as the experience of the SWES and the introduction of the CNRF has shown, there is always more we can learn and do.  Beyond that, the three key elements I have outlined above can be applied in different institutional settings to achieve similar positive outcomes.
At the heart of what I am advocating for is a strategy policy framework that considers the interaction between monetary and financial stability policy for the effectiveness of central banks to achieve their goals, complemented by clarity in communications about the motivations for those actions in an increasingly risky and uncertain world. Understanding the mutual benefit for monetary policy and financial stability policymakers to share their analyses of the economic environment and potential shocks is at the core of a robust central bank policy strategy framework.

The Bank’s approach has evolved since Charlie Bean set out a compelling case for the deployment of macroprudential instruments, rather than monetary policy, to enhance financial stability. It is eloquently outlined in a speech by Sarah Breeden in 2023 where she demonstrated how monetary and financial stability are separate but complementary, and inherently intertwined – two sides of the same coin.

Similarly, the Federal Reserve’s “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” (adopted effective January 24, 2012; as reaffirmed effective January 30, 2024) argues “[S]ustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability depends on a stable financial system. Therefore, the [Federal Open Market] Committee’s policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.”

For a further discussion of the flow effects from asset purchases on yields see, for example, Du et al (2024) and Waller (2024). In the latest BoE annual BEAR conference, Annette Vissing-Jorgensen and Isabel Schnabel, two of the leading figures in the field, highlighted the importance of considering the ‘convenience yield’ differential across assets to avoid unintended financial consequences (slides and recordings of their presentations can be found here ). Further details of the role of QE and QT on liquidity are discussed in Smith and Valcarcel (2024) and Kaminska et al (2025) .

The distribution of reserves, as well as money market frictions can lead to heterogenous effects across commercial banks. For example, Kumhof and Salgado-Moreno (2024) develop a New Keynesian model to investigate the interactions between QE/QT with interest rate policy and their transmission to the real economy via the reserve and interbank market, in a model with a rich financial system that incorporates heterogenous banks as well as non-bank financial institutions.

Acharya et al (2023) argue that central bank liquidity expansions lead to financial stability weakness when the central bank tries to remove liquidity from the system. They show, using US data, that commercial banks issued more demand and less time deposits during QE but that they did not reduce these claims on liquid liabilities during QT eliciting a trade-off between monetary policy and financial stability.

Christensen and Krogstrup (2019) show that liquidity effects from QE arising from the liability side of the central bank are significant and independent from the standard portfolio rebalance effects using an event study approach that exploits the unique set-up of LSAPs by the Swiss National Bank in 2011.

The heat is on: why monetary policy makers are increasingly focusing on the impact of climate risks - speech by James Talbot
Speech
Introduction
We are used to thinking of climate change as something that happens in the long run.
For monetary policy makers, the focus is predominantly on responding to the shorter-term dynamics of the economy in order to achieve the inflation target. So why am I here today to talk about climate in the context of monetary policy?
Central banks have been assessing the financial stability risks from climate change for a decade or more. The former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney gave a speech in September 2015 on the impact of climate change on financial stability’. footnote  Then in 2019, the Bank of England set supervisory expectations for banks and insurers on the management of climate-related financial risks footnote  . In 2020, my colleague Sarah Breeden led the development of the first vintage of climate scenarios at the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) footnote  footnote  and the Bank of England’s climate exploratory scenario in 2021 footnote  . All of this work established the case that climate is a risk to the financial system.
Central banks then turned to focus on the risks from climate change to their own balance sheets and to monetary policy operations, such as asset purchases. Sabine Mauderer led NGFS work to explore how monetary operations might need to adapt to a hotter world and the Bank of England set out how to green our Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme footnote  .
But assessing the implications of climate change for monetary policy itself is a relatively newer line of enquiry. The ECB’s Isabel Schnabel explored this issue in a speech in 2022 footnote  . In 2023, my colleague Catherine Mann – a member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee – expressed the view that monetary policy makers could not ignore the effects of climate change footnote  .
So why is the focus of monetary policy makers on the impact of climate change increasing?
This can be a controversial question, but I think the answer is simple. Monetary policy makers need to take account of any macro-relevant shock which occurs over the monetary policy horizon – typically thought of as the next 2-3 years. And the most difficult shocks to deal with are those which push inflation and output in different directions – so called “trade-off inducing” shocks. There is evidence that the impact of climate change is increasingly exhibiting these characteristics.
Before I dig into that further, let me make three introductory points on how central banks think about this issue –
First, we take the scientific evidence on climate change as given. We are only interested in how this affects the economy and financial system, and therefore the achievement of our statutory objectives.
Second, the policies needed to mitigate climate change are for governments, not central banks, to decide. But while we take those policies as given, they will have economic impacts and where there is uncertainty about the path for those policies, that can also affect economic behaviour.
Third, this is not about whether central banks should change their remits in response to climate change. Not least because different central banks have different mandates. The Bank of England’s monetary policy remit is set by the government. It is clear that price stability is our primary goal, and subject to that we support the economic objectives of the government.
However, the key thing that unites all central banks, is that if climate change – or the policies enacted to mitigate it – affect economic outcomes, it is a relevant consideration for monetary policy makers just like any other economic shock.
Starting with the scientific evidence: the IPCC footnote  estimates that average global temperatures are now more than one degree higher than pre-industrial levels and are set to rise at 0.2°C per decade, due to past and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions. 2024 was the warmest year on record, with average global temperatures exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. As climate change has accelerated, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events has already increased; and even small increases in global temperature are expected to have significant impacts in future.
Annual global damages from weather-related hazards have more than doubled in real terms in the past twenty years footnote  . Last year alone, natural catastrophes resulted in global economic losses of over $300 billion footnote  .  According to the Swiss Re Institute, annual insured losses for natural catastrophes have been growing by between 5%–7% per year on average for the last three decades, and this trend is anticipated to continue.
There is also evidence that we are already seeing macroeconomically-relevant impacts from a changing climate. Even countries like the UK, which may be less susceptible to large climate shocks, can be affected by the impact of events abroad. International food commodity prices are one example, as noted by the Governor in a recent speech (2023) footnote  . A study by Peersman (2022) footnote  shows how unanticipated increases in global food commodity prices have both reduced output and increased inflation in advanced economies.
At the same time, governments across the world are implementing policies to transition to a less carbon-intensive economy in order to prevent the large and longer-term damages from a changing climate. Just under a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions are currently covered by some form of carbon pricing mechanism, which aims to internalise the negative externalities created by these emissions. In the UK and EU, the price of carbon in the Emissions Trading System has been rising and is set to increase further over the next three years. Sectoral coverage is expanding; new carbon-intensive import taxes are being introduced; and both the supply of permits, and the share given for free, are being cut.
In short, the impact of climate change is becoming a macroeconomically-relevant shock over the monetary policy horizon as well as affecting our societies and economies in the longer-term. In light of that, over the past three years, members of the NGFS have come together to develop a framework and analytical foundation to model and understand the impact of climate change on the economy. This is summarised in three new reports published last year footnote  .  At the Bank of England too, we have been developing our toolkit to understand the impact of climate change on the UK economy.
The final thing I want to emphasise by way of introduction is that while the climate transition might seem like a “problem” for monetary policy, the “no transition” scenario looks much worse. There is no better illustration of this than in the latest NGFS scenarios, which show that while policies to tackle climate change may present an inflation/output trade-off for monetary policymakers to deal with in the near term, the economic costs of climate inaction would be a far worse shock to deal with further ahead. Losses from the chronic impacts of climate change footnote  without further policy action are expected to be close to 15% of global GDP by 2050 relative to the theoretical baseline without climate change. That is almost two-thirds greater than the combined losses from physical and transition risks under a scenario which is compatible with reaching net zero in 2050.
In the rest of the speech, I will talk about the work of the NGFS and the Bank of England to better understand the macroeconomic impacts of climate change before turning to how monetary policy makers might factor these changes into decision making. I’ll finish by giving some current and proposed examples of how we might operationalise that.
Understanding the impact of climate change
Let me start with how to assess the impact of physical risks.
There are (at least) three dimensions. First, the nature and type of physical hazard. Second, the level of economic activity at the location where the shock occurs. And third, the vulnerability of assets and economic activity to physical events, reflecting construction quality, disaster preparedness, and response capacity. Here, adaptation measures, for example building flood barriers, are vital to increase resilience to severe weather events.
What matters to monetary policy is how the shock affects supply and demand and over what horizon.
Starting with supply : there can be immediate destruction of physical goods, capital and infrastructure as well as displacement of workers. Bank of England research looked at the impact of flooding on UK firms footnote  from 2011 to 2021. It found a significant increase in the probability of business termination as a result of a flooding event for both small and medium-sized firms. And for those corporates surviving, flooding is associated with a 28% and 15% reduction in turnover in the year of the shock for large and medium-sized firms respectively.
Productivity may also fall given the impact of physical hazards on labour and agricultural land, or via diversion of attention and resources to reconstruction efforts. For example, heatwaves may reduce manufacturing productivity, and a drought will often impact agricultural productivity. Business relocation in response to a chronic increase in the exposure to physical risk can also have a significant impact.
Severe weather events can also negatively impact the demand side of the economy in the near term. Destruction and loss of assets impacts income and wealth, which puts downward pressure on consumption. These effects come through a variety of channels including: the destruction of housing and disruption of wage payments or business income as well as greater uncertainty about growth and income prospects, which may depress confidence, reducing investment and increasing precautionary savings.
There are also financial channels which could amplify these effects. Asset prices may fall because of the current or expected destruction of physical assets. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that house prices are negatively affected by current or expected physical hazards. footnote  So the value of collateral that borrowers can pledge to secure a loan can fall. Reduced insurance availability could also put downward pressure on house prices as insurers face increased claims as the physical impacts of climate change progress. footnote  In addition, if banks’ balance sheets are adversely affected, this can affect their willingness and ability to lend.
The overall impact on output and inflation will depend on how supply and demand are affected and the response of monetary policy .  Econometric studies on the macroeconomic effects from severe weather events find that the growth rate of GDP drops by around 0.5 percentage points (pp) on average in the immediate aftermath. footnote  footnote  A previous study by Raddatz (2009) footnote  estimated that a climate-related disaster resulted in a cumulative per-capita output loss of 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% for high, middle and low-income countries respectively. Countries with a lower resilience threshold footnote  also tend to see bigger effects footnote  . De Winne and Peersman (2021) footnote  show that a 10% increase in global food commodity prices stemming from weather-related shocks lowers GDP by 0.5% after six quarters across a panel of 75 countries.
Adaptation measures and effective insurance can limit the economic fallout from severe weather events. Faster insurance payouts can help to speed up the recovery and help to limit the reduction in consumption. footnote  However, research suggests that 55% of global losses from physical hazards are currently not insured, and this may rise in future.
A government’s ability and willingness to provide fiscal support is another important determinant of economic outcomes . Indeed, more frequent and severe weather events can diminish fiscal capacity and impair insurance provision, which can further increase the impact of shocks, particularly in emerging market and developing economies (Noy 2009) footnote  .
The inflation impact depends on the type of disaster and the structural composition of the economy. Parker (2018) footnote  draws a distinction between storms, which increase food price inflation, and floods, which increase headline inflation more broadly. A study by Peersman (2022) footnote  showed that in response to a 1% unanticipated increase in globally-traded food prices, euro-area real GDP declined by 0.1% and headline inflation rose by 0.1%. Our own work at the Bank of England shows broadly comparable results for the UK.
These impacts seem set to increase further as shocks become more frequent and severe. Kotz et al (2023) footnote  find that the summer 2022 extreme heat caused a cumulative impact of 0.7 percentage points on annual food price inflation and 0.3pp on annual headline inflation Europe. The paper also presents scenarios where the impact on inflation will increase substantially in future. Ficarra and Mari (2025) footnote  show that a one standard deviation increase in the number of UK floods would reduce regional output by 1% and raise regional inflation by 0.5% at the two-year horizon.
It is little wonder, therefore, that governments have turned their attention to reducing the risks related to unmitigated climate change. But these actions will also have an economic impact too. So let me turn to that next.
The shift towards a lower-carbon economy will affect how firms produce; how households consume; how governments spend and raise taxes; how banks and investors allocate finance; and can have international spillover effects.
For ease, let’s focus on two types of transition policy: (i) carbon pricing and (ii) government subsidies or investment. The aggregate macroeconomic impacts of these policies will vary depending on their design, pace, stringency, credibility and the degree of coordination across countries.
In the short run, higher carbon prices can act as a negative supply shock leading to an increase in inflation and a fall in output. Over the medium and longer term, the overall macroeconomic impacts will depend on policy design, sectoral coverage and how tax revenues are spent. A gradual and predictable rise in the carbon price results in smaller increases in inflation footnote  . Conversely, a more rapid price increase due to a delayed transition could create greater volatility, requiring central banks to react by more, with correspondingly greater impacts on output footnote  .
The macroeconomic impacts of green subsidy schemes will depend on: the design and how they are financed as well as any supply bottlenecks. Directly subsidising private investments in green sectors, can act as a positive demand shock increasing both output and inflation. Whereas subsidising the price of green inputs can look more like a positive supply shock, increasing output but reducing inflation. The effect on overall inflation in the medium term will also depend on the impact on inflation expectations and the reaction of monetary policy.
At the Bank, we have already begun to study these effects for the UK. Let me talk about some of this work.
First, the impact on investment. A net zero-consistent pathway for the UK requires average financing of around £37 billion per year between 2030 to 2050, according to estimates by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) footnote  . Indeed, evidence from the    Bank of England’s Decision Maker Panel footnote  survey suggests climate policies are already impacting the behaviour of UK firms. In 2024, UK firms reported that climate-related investments were set to rise from 2.5% of capital expenditures over the past three years to 5.5% in the next three years: an additional £13bn of green investment. Larger firms and those with higher energy intensity production expect the highest investment. And firms expect action to increase in the coming years.
Second, the impact on growth and inflation. Using a structural model, Bank colleagues find that increases in carbon prices in the ETS push up on inflation and down on output in both the UK and euro area. The UK model estimates that over the period 2008-2024, a 10% carbon price increase triggers an immediate rise in energy price inflation of 0.8pp. This is followed by a smaller but more persistent rise in non-energy price inflation, of around 0.15pp at its peak, suggesting pass-through to energy-intensive sectors. There is also a lagged and temporary fall in the level of GDP.
While a shock of this magnitude is illustrative, these dynamics suggest that when viewed in isolation, policies to increase the price of carbon operate much like other supply-side shocks in the economy, although these models do not capture the offsetting positive impact of avoided physical damages.
Over the next few years – in other words, the current monetary policy horizon – the impact of carbon pricing on the economy could intensify. ETS sectoral coverage is set to expand and as free allocations are phased out for other sectors, carbon price rises could exert more ‘direct’ upward pressure on headline inflation.
Third, spillover effects from abroad. Bank researchers footnote  have examined the potential spillover effects to the UK of carbon pricing and green subsidy policies implemented by major trading partners, using a two-country, two-sector DSGE model. The analysis suggests that an increase in green subsidies abroad is expansionary for the UK, as UK production expands to meet rising trading partner demand for UK exports. The model suggests UK inflation initially decreases due to cheaper imports, though it eventually rises alongside the higher UK economic activity. Conversely, increasing carbon prices abroad push up on UK inflation as UK imports become more expensive. While UK green goods exporters might benefit from rising demand for their products, the contractionary effect on trading partner output gradually decreases the demand for UK exports, which lowers UK output. So, for a small open economy, transition policies overseas seem to have similar economic effects to those at home.
Implications for monetary policy makers
The body of research and analysis I have just discussed suggests that the impact of both the physical effects of climate and the climate transition are growing in size and may increasingly represent a trade-off inducing shock for monetary policy makers to deal with.
But how should policy makers think about this? In order to answer this question, I am going to adapt a framework from a recent speech by Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the Governor of the Banque de France. footnote  He considers five characteristics that are important for assessing how a climate shock or policy transmits through the economy.
First, the persistence . If it is temporary, the classic prescription is for monetary policy to look through the first-round effects of a trade-off inducing shock. However, if natural disasters become more frequent and severe, it becomes harder to do that, not least because of the need for monetary policy to lean against second round effects in order to keep inflation expectations anchored.
Second, the size of the shock . Many studies have found that in the past, climate-related shocks have been relatively small. But they are likely to grow: Kotz et al (2023) footnote  show that that without adaptation measures, annual global food price inflation may increase by 1-3ppby 2035, increasing headline inflation by between 0.3-1.2 pp. Those sorts of numbers would be very monetary-policy relevant.
Third, if a shock affects sectors that are key nodes in the economy, it will have larger and more persistent effects. There is evidence of this already footnote  : the 2022 droughts led to low water levels on the Rhine, which led to material falls in German industrial production. That is because the river plays an important role in the transportation of raw materials that are at the beginning of production chains, causing knock-on disruption to finished goods.
Fourth, the salience for households of affected sectors. Studies footnote  suggest that households’ inflation expectations are particularly influenced by price changes for items that they buy more frequently, such as food and energy, which are both particularly exposed to climate change.
Fifth, the predictability of a shock. Natural disasters are by their nature highly unpredictable, even if the increasing frequency of their occurrence is more certain. Transition policies that are clear and implemented gradually, like a carbon tax phased in over a number of years, are less likely to lead to sudden volatility in inflation and output.
In short, this all sounds quite similar to the shocks monetary policy makers have faced in recent years – large, unpredictable, but persistent supply shocks in areas of salience for households, which in some cases have disrupted supply chains.
Indeed, if it sounds like more of the same, then I would argue that this is important for central banks in the context of the experience of the past few years. Not least because failure to act in response to these shocks could lead to second round effects, affecting wage bargaining and inflation expectations. There is ample evidence in the literature footnote  that at higher levels of inflation, and as inflationary shocks occur more frequently, households and firms pay more attention to current inflation when forming their expectations.
So as acute physical shocks occur more frequently, monetary policymakers will need to understand the economic impact of these shocks and may need to react to them in order to keep inflation expectations anchored.
Let’s take a look at some examples. For disaster-prone countries footnote  , it’s clear that a trade-off between near-term inflation and falling output arises frequently. In general, policymakers are more likely to tighten than relax policy in response to these shocks as they act to offset inflationary pressures. As physical events become more frequent and severe across a number of countries, the likelihood of second-round effects on inflation will increase, especially if agents start to incorporate expectations of future climate shocks into their inflation expectations.
Turning to transition policies, some of my colleagues at the Bank of England have used a climate DSGE model to look at how the announced future path for carbon pricing and green government spending policies affect the UK economy and therefore monetary policy. Importantly, the model assumes less than full anticipation of the policies to be implemented. In the medium run, these policies push down on output and up on    inflation – in short, we have the classic trade off again. Monetary policy is forced to tighten in the near term, with the degree of restriction lessening further out because negative effects on output begin to materialise.
Modelling assumptions are important though. First, the model includes none of the acute physical damages avoided in the longer-term by transitioning to net zero. Second, the overall impact will depend on exactly how the carbon tax is implemented and the way that revenues are recycled back into the economy. Third, the model also takes no view of the longer-run effects on the supply side of the economy – indeed, while the efficiency of the economy will be reduced as fossil fuels are phased out, if new green technologies are more efficient in the long-run, then productivity will rise further out.
Where do we go from here?
As I noted at the beginning, we’ve been working on these issues over the past three years in the NGFS. One of the key strengths of the network is the diversity of its membership. This means that not only do we have a lot of central banks thinking about these issues – 105 at last count – but more than sixty of those members have come together to set out a framework and analytical foundation to model and understand the impact of climate change on the economy. These central banks bring different skills and experiences – they span all five continents and include oil exporters and importers; low income, emerging market and advanced economies; and countries where the physical effects of climate have already become much more prominent.
More broadly, what I have learned from this work is: don’t let the best be the enemy of the good – get going on the modelling! While some central banks now have models which factor in climate considerations, the impact of the transition can be modelled using relatively conventional models such as those used to assess the impact of taxes and subsidies. These are detailed in the NGFS macro-modelling Handbook we published last year footnote  .
On the physical side – modelling remains more challenging, as it requires the combination of two disciplines: economics and climate science. The most common approach to model physical economic impacts is to use Integrated Assessment Models, which link an emissions pathway to macro impacts via the use of a “damage function”. These are more appropriate for modelling more gradual, chronic physical impacts. Damage functions are a field of active research, with improvements being made over time. For example, the 2025 NGFS long-term scenarios show much larger damages for chronic climate impacts than in previous vintages. Other models are also required to reflect acute physical factors – to allow for unanticipated, higher frequency shocks.
The next phase of the NGFS monetary-policy work will build on this practical experience. We are exploring how the impacts of climate change can be integrated into monetary policy decision-making, including via a modelling collaboration with the IMF using their GMMET model footnote  . Indeed, some central banks have already embedded climate-related variables in their nowcasting methods for GDP and inflation. Whereas others are beginning to explore climate scenarios for monetary policy purposes.
At the Bank of England, we have been developing our capabilities to explore the transmission of climate shocks and to assess our forecast errors. For example, Bank analysis suggests that climate transition policies were probably more important contributors to recent movements in inflation than we previously thought footnote  .
More broadly, we have begun to act on the recommendations of the Bernanke review - the independent review of forecasting for monetary policy making and communication at the Bank of England. As part of our response to this review, we plan to make more systematic use of scenarios for monetary policy – as described in Lombardelli (2024) footnote  – which could include weather and energy-related scenarios where appropriate. Such scenarios would sit alongside a central projection and allow the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee to consider the implications of these alternative assumptions in their monetary policy deliberations.
Conclusion
Let me sum up with four conclusions.
First, there is evidence that the physical effects of climate change are having an increasing impact on output and inflation over monetary-policy relevant horizons. This means that monetary policymakers need to understand these risks as part of their deliberations.
Second, understanding the nature of climate shocks is important. While their impact will vary, these shocks may look similar to those that monetary policy makers have faced in recent years – large, unpredictable and potentially persistent, supply shocks. In other words, they may increasingly present difficult inflation-output trade-offs for policymakers to manage.
Different central banks have different mandates, but if climate is a macro-relevant shock over the monetary policy horizon, then central banks will need to understand it. The first phase of our work in the NGFS has laid out an analytical framework and offered guidance on how to model climate shocks. These are also active areas of research at the     Bank of England too.
Third, this is not about using monetary policy to tackle the climate transition. That is a job for government policy. At the Bank of England, our monetary policy mandate is to maintain price stability – defined as an inflation rate of 2% – and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the UK government. The best contribution monetary policy can make to the climate transition is therefore to ensure economic stability. But in order to do that, we need to understand the impact of climate change on the economy.
Finally, governments are increasing actions to tackle climate change in order to avoid catastrophic economic damages in the future. Although the climate transition might seem like a problem for monetary policy to deal with, delaying it will only accrue greater difficulties for monetary policy further down the road. footnote  So as the transition progresses, the Bank of England will respond to it by continuing to set monetary policy to ensure that we achieve our inflation target. Just as we do with any other shock we face.

Physical risks can be described as chronic or acute. Chronic risks relate to long-term shifts in climate patterns like rising temperatures and sea levels, while acute risks arise from extreme weather events, such as floods, heatwaves and wildfires.

The shorter-term financial impact of flooding on households is likely to be limited, as around 90% of residential properties are insured. This is in part due to the existence of Flood Re, a joint reinsurance initiative between the Government and the insurance industry. As physical climate-related risks increase over the longer term, and the Flood Re scheme ends, financial stability risks could develop. In the Bank’s CBES, under the ‘No Additional Action’ scenario, insurers projected that insurance for around 7% of (or approximately two million) UK households would become unaffordable or unavailable.

Emerging market and developing economies face much larger shocks to their economies following a disaster of similar magnitude ( Noy, 2009 ) reflecting their lower resilience threshold. A climate disaster results in a cumulative per-capita output loss of 0.5 and 0.25% for middle and high-income countries, while the losses amount to 1% among low-income countries (Raddatz, 2009 ). However, the smaller effects of weather shocks in higher income countries do not mean that they are immune to the effects of climate change ( Kahn et al., 2021 ).

Central bank communications and uncertainty - remarks by Clare Lombardelli
Remarks
Thank you for inviting me to speak today.
It seems the Bank of England has become something of a trendsetter by having Ben Bernanke evaluate our monetary policy arrangements. We’re incredibly grateful to Ben for the time and thought he put into his advice to us. His insights are proving invaluable in enabling us to change our approach for the better.
The emphasis of Ben’s review for the Bank of England was on the Monetary Policy Committee’s processes for policy making, our tools and our communications during times of high uncertainty and structural change. So it was not a framework review, like the Federal Reserve is currently undertaking. There’s an important reason for that difference – namely that the key elements of the UK institutional framework for monetary policy are set by Government, not by the Bank or its Monetary Policy Committee.
There are a lot of similarities in the themes from Ben’s reviews of the Bank of England and the paper he has just presented on proposals to improve the Federal Reserve’s communications. In particular, in both reports he notes the unhelpful emphasis on a single, central forecast and the way that current communication frameworks struggle to adequately convey sufficient information about policy strategy, especially under conditions of uncertainty.
For the Federal Reserve he goes into further detail and makes practical proposals on some key areas we are also reflecting on and may change in our practice. Particularly: what is an input to policy making and what is an output; the respective roles of staff and policymakers in forecasts, scenarios and other judgements; and what policy paths to use in published analytical material. These issues are important. Different central banks handle them differently reflecting differences in institutional set-up and the pros and cons of different approaches. There is no ‘correct answer’ on the specifics, but as Ben’s two reviews show, there are some common themes that point towards good practice.
The Bank of England approaches Ben's conclusion that it is useful to use a baseline forecast and scenarios from a different place to the Federal Reserve. We heavily anchor our analytical processes and communications of the policy decision around our central forecast.
So it is quite a philosophical change as we move to explicitly focus less on a central forecast, and instead consider a wider range of scenarios for both policymaking and communications.
Our forecast-based approach to communication has risked the impression that monetary policymakers at the Bank of England put more weight on a single view of the outlook, or that we have more certainty, than we actually do. In reality, our policy discussion is more comprehensive, more lively and exposes a wider range of views, as our published one-member, one-vote structure makes transparent.
Of course we have always discussed uncertainty and risks in our communication products. And we have long used fan charts to show uncertainty around inflation and output. Fan charts have their advocates and are a powerful visual representation of uncertainty. But they have limitations, including in enabling people to understand how and why the economy may be different to a baseline forecast.
Scenarios can play a valuable role in both policymaking and communication.
For monetary policymakers, scenarios can help to shed light on economic forces that might shape the macroeconomic outlook. They are quantitative exercises, if inevitably highly stylised. The quantification helps policymakers understand the extent to which certain economic shocks and mechanisms may or may not have material effects on the outlook. It also helps them explore possible trade-offs between stabilising inflation and mitigating output volatility and the possible policy responses.
The process of producing scenarios also helps staff to learn more about the reliability and robustness of those scenarios: for example, how reliant they are on assumptions about parameters or mechanisms that we have relatively little information or evidence on. This is also useful information for policymakers. Overall, while scenarios provide valuable quantitative results, the main lessons for monetary policymakers will often be directional and qualitative.
One of the most useful elements of the policy process at the Bank of England is the internal discussion among MPC members and with the staff, which explores what are the most important questions shaping our respective policy views and how we can learn from each other. That discussion shapes policymakers’ views and our votes. In this context, forecasts and scenarios are most useful when they bring issues to life, facilitating that conversation and allowing each of us to learn from others’ perspectives.
The discussions of policy strategy and tools yesterday demonstrated how scenarios can also help us think about policy ‘robustness’. For example, Silvana Tenreyro talked about the value of considering different scenarios when considering guidance, including conditional guidance on balance sheet tools – they enable policymakers to think practically about how that guidance would stand up in different circumstances.
In his opening remarks at this conference Chair Powell talked of the need for clear communications and also the need to convey the uncertainty that surrounds our understanding of the economic outlook.
In this context, the potential benefits of scenarios are obvious. They provide clear narratives or stories that bring to life not only how the economy may evolve differently but also the economic forces that could be driving those differences. They can highlight the features policymakers are most focussed on and how they would react if the economy evolved in that way. They can also speak to a wider audience than fan charts and similar tools, which can be quite specialist and technical.
Ben’s paper on Federal Reserve communications also draws out how scenarios can help overcome a frequent challenge for policy communications. By underscoring how the future path of policy is conditional. The publication of selected alternative scenarios makes explicit how policy will depend on the evolution of the economy. By giving a concrete example, it brings that point to life.
In communicating monetary policy to observers, we aim to give clear and simple messages. But the credibility of, and trust in, central banks will be enhanced if we acknowledge the genuine uncertainty that policymakers need to confront. It does not inspire confidence or support credibility to ignore it. Scenarios can help communicate that uncertainty and the factors that policymakers may need to react to if uncertainties crystalise. We need to do that in a way that does not overload people and guides observers to what policymakers judge is most important.
This direction of travel is consistent with the idea that inflation targeting is not intended to suggest that monetary policy can fine-tune the trajectories of activity and inflation. Instead, it is a broad framework to guide policy and what people should expect from policy, thereby anchoring inflation expectations as Carl Walsh emphasised yesterday.
If the Federal Reserve were to move towards an economic review-type product, as Ben suggests, it would need to answer the question of whose report it is, or who is the ‘owner’ of its components. In the UK, our historical approach has been to publish a forecast that represents the best collective judgement of the Monetary Policy Committee.
In part that is because, in our framework, the Committee is required to set out our view of the outlook. Rightly so given the importance of transparency and accountability. One practical difference with the FOMC is that we have a smaller committee of nine people, geographically located together. This makes it easier to support a very interactive process.
However, our historical approach to producing a best collective judgement forecast potentially created pressures to compress the Committee’s views and judgements through a single funnel. So we are going to move away from that to a forecast based on an initial staff proposal, that a majority of the Committee agree is a reasonable basis for discussions. This approach shares some similarities with the Riksbank and Norges Bank, perhaps unsurprisingly given that our institutional structures share some similarities.
In moving away from a best collective judgement forecast, we are recognising there is no single view of the central outlook across the Committee and creating more space for individual policymakers to debate different views before finalising their policy judgements. This will allow us to better harness the deep expertise within the Committee, which has broad diversity of views and experience built in. At the same time it will liberate the Committee from the fine details of the forecast and enable more focus on policy strategy.
At the Bank of England, we are excited about the benefits that these changes can bring. But we realise that we are on a journey and so conscious that there is a huge amount to learn. That is why events like this, which offer the opportunity to learn from others travelling similar journeys, are so valuable. With that in mind, let me thank the organisers of this conference for putting together such a thought-provoking event. From a Federal Reserve perspective, it may be targeted at your framework review, but I can assure you that it is enormously useful for the wider central banking community.

State of trade - speech by Andrew Bailey
In this speech, Andrew Bailey discusses the importance of trade in goods and financial services – particularly to open economies like the UK and Ireland – and highlights the need for reforms in the world trading system.
Speech
It is a great pleasure to be in Dublin, and I want to start by thanking the Irish Association of Investment Managers for inviting me again to speak. I say again because I also have to begin with an apology, for standing you up last year at short notice when the General Election was called in the UK. And so, my other thanks is to my fellow Governor Gabriel, for stepping in last year when I withdrew at short notice.
Not much has happened in the last year. To keep it topical, I am going to use my time to talk about trade, both in goods and in financial services. This is not only topical but highly relevant, because Ireland and the UK are both open economies, with long-established trade connections, and likewise strong connections in financial services.
Trade matters. It matters at both the economy-wide or macro level, and at the level of individual firms, the micro level. And, almost needless to say, the two are closely linked.
I am going to start by laying out key elements of the big picture, before moving on to talk about financial services. My starting point is two key elements of the macro dimension of trade. In many past times in talking about trade it would have been easy to pass over them, as points that are not contested. I think they need repeating today.
The first point is that trade supports output in the economy – and it is good for economic welfare. As I will come on to, there are important qualifications to this point, but they don’t invalidate it. From Adam Smith onwards, it has broadly been accepted that trade supports specialisation and efficiency of production and it enables knowledge transfer, and these features support productivity and economic growth.
The second point is that we should not expect trade between countries to be in balance all of the time. The whole world should be in balance – because it is a closed system as we have not found and started trading with extra-terrestrial life yet. But as individual countries, we are not closed, as Ireland and the UK demonstrate. Unfortunately, the world’s exports and imports don’t usually equal each other, but that’s down to our counting not ET.
However, since trade balances between countries don’t balance – and they should not be expected to do so, - what determines the balances and patterns of trade? At the whole economy, or macro, level the answer is that trade is determined by the balance between a country’s saving and investment – macroeconomic fundamentals. And, these are shaped by factors such as business conditions and cycles, productivity growth, savings behaviour, interest rates, fiscal policy choices and exchange rates. In other words, trade is an outcome of the big driving forces of economies, and if we want to affect trade patterns on a lasting basis, that’s where we should look.
Well, up to a point, yes. I am conscious that what I have just said is a rather a textbook espousal of the case for free trade. No apologies, I do believe in free trade. But, I’m also aware that things are not that simple – the story doesn’t end there. Trade patterns are also shaped by national policies, particularly industrial policies, and by the rules–based world trading system that seeks to set the guardrails for such policies.
Now, the argument, as I interpret it, of the US Administration is that those rules have been stretched beyond breaking point, and actions have to be taken to put this right.
As I read it, there are two parts to this argument.
The first is that the rules of the world trade system – based around the World Trade Organisation – have broken down, and are in need of reform. IMF staff have pointed to more use of industrial policies around the world in recent years, and argued that these should only be used for very limited domestic objectives such as local market failures, but that has not been the case of late, and that this practice will and has exacerbated trade tensions. More concretely, between 2009 and 2022 China implemented around 5,400 so-called subsidy policies, which were concentrated in priority sectors, i.e., ones that matter. This was equal to about two-thirds of all the subsidy measures adopted by G20 advanced economies combined.
The macro story on trade is influenced by what goes on at the micro level, and we can’t see these two as distinct. There has been an increase in the use of industrial policies – one country has been active on this front, but it’s not alone.
The second point is around how the rules of engagement of the world trade system have come under pressure from new developments which have affected all of us. Let me briefly set out two which are closely linked. First, before the outbreak of Covid world trade had grown rapidly, more rapidly than world output, and in doing so the supply chains for final products had become much more complicated, but also efficient in the sense that they had exploited the benefits of trade.
This meant that a lot more of world trade comprised so-called intermediate goods – inputs to the final product, but not the product itself. This exploited one of the longest standing principles of free trade – so-called comparative advantage. In other words, produce stuff where it is most efficient relatively speaking to do so, accepting that the relative point means that no country should specialise in everything. Over time, the trade system has become more and more refined – we have heard the phrase “just in time delivery”. This was highly efficient, until it wasn’t.
Covid dealt a blow to the efficiency of the trade system. Even though initial pandemic-related supply chain disruption was resolved quite rapidly, as we recovered from Covid these trading patterns and systems did not return to normal as quickly and fully as we expected.
Why was that? There were no doubt a number of reasons, but a large one is the growth of national security concerns as a threat to the efficiency of trade. In reality, sadly, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine provided real evidence of the disruption that can happen, and is one factor behind a growing threat from national security to our assumptions on frictionless trade. To be clear, national security concerns are not a good reason to retreat indiscriminately from global trade. The best way to ensure resilience to geopolitical risk is not by reshoring production, but by diversifying supply chains among reliable partners who abide by international law.
Viewed from the perspective of a central bank responsible for monetary policy, the inevitable conclusion is that we cannot assume that the supply sides of our economies behave as efficiently as they did before Covid. And this was a substantial cause of the very difficult upsurge in inflation.
I am going to conclude on broader trade with a number of points, and then say something on financial services. Four points strike me as very important on trade.
First, while I am an unshaken believer in free trade, I do accept that the system has come under too much strain, we have to work hard now to rebuild it, and it is incorrect to dismiss those who argue for restrictions on trade as just wrong-headed. We need to understand what lies behind these arguments. That said, I want to get back to an open trading system.
Second, to solve the issues we face, we need to look at the macro level – the big economic drivers that I mentioned earlier, and call out where and why we think there are unsustainable trade imbalances. We need to strengthen the IMF’s surveillance in order to improve the process for calling out unsustainable trade imbalances. But we must also look at the micro-level – the rules based world trade system - and work out what we need to do to solve this problem and make it more effective again.
Third, if it is believed that tariff action is needed to create the shock and awe to get these issues on to the table and dealt with, then something has gone wrong with the multilateral system, and we need to deal with that.
Fourth, creating a sustainable world trading system matters to all of us. It matters to countries like Ireland and the UK, which are highly open economies, and have been throughout their development. And it matters to central bankers and economic policymakers because our jobs are much harder if we face more inflexible and uncertain supply side conditions in our economies, as we appear to do today.
Almost all of the attention in recent months in the area of trade has been on goods trade – tangible stuff. Tariffs are a tool whose use is largely confined to the world of goods trade. But, there are two other important features of the trade world. First, alongside trade in goods sits trade in services-intangibles. For the UK, the latest numbers indicate that the total volume of trade was made up of 54% goods and 46% services. For Ireland the numbers are 28% goods and 72% services.
Financial services are an important part of trade in services and particularly so for Ireland and the UK.
The second important feature of the trade world is that alongside tariffs sit non-tariff barriers. These are all sorts of obstacles to trade, some put in place deliberately, some are features with their origin in other objectives than affecting the flow of trade, and others which are just there who knows why. Non-tariff barriers to trade are by no means limited to trade in services, but they are the dominant form of restriction in that world.
This brings me to Brexit. I have to start with an important disclaimer. As a public servant, I take no position on Brexit per se – it was a decision of the British people, and has been put into effect. That said, our evolving trading and regulatory relationship with the EU requires many judgements on the most effective way to do so – what delivers the most effective outcome.
I want to make two important points in this context. The first relates more to trade in goods, the second to financial services. Let me start with goods. I said earlier that trade enhances and supports economic activity.
It follows that if the level of trade is lowered by some action, it will have an effect to reduce productivity growth and thus overall growth. Just as tariffs, by increasing the cost, can reduce the scale of trade, the same goes for the type of non-tariff barrier that Brexit has created. Now to reiterate, this does not mean that Brexit is wrong, because there can be other reasons for it, but it does suggest, I think powerfully, that we should do all we can to minimise negative effects on trade.
The evidence on Brexit suggests that in the UK the changing trade relationship has weighed on the level of potential supply.
I conclude from this that, just as the Windsor Agreement on trade involving the UK and Ireland was a welcome step forward, so too are the initiatives of the current UK Government to rebuild trade between the UK and EU, and of course there is a very particular important aspect here for the UK and Ireland.
Let me turn to financial services. There is often an impression given that the flow of trade in financial services is predominantly from the UK to the EU. In other words, the UK is an exporter of financial services. This creates the notion of a one-way street, and that leads to the image of a dependency, and from there the notion of the dependency in some sense being unhealthy starts to come in.
My strong view is that – contrary to this one way idea – the relationship goes both ways, and that is a good thing. And, this is very well illustrated by the relationship between Ireland and the UK in the area of financial services.
Let me draw out the two-way street point some more, using the example of the 2022 shock to Liability Driven Investment funds connected to UK pension funds, so-called LDI funds. The LDI episode occurred when UK financial assets saw a significant repricing, with a particular impact on long-dated gilts. The Financial Policy Committee at the Bank of England judged that UK financial stability was at risk due to dysfunction in the gilt market and recommended that the Bank take action. This action took the form of intervening via temporary purchases of long-dated gilts.
Many of the funds involved were domiciled in other jurisdictions, including here in Ireland and Luxembourg. To be very clear, domicile was not a part of the problem. But, it had to help to enable the solution, and it did. A co-ordinated response between the UK, Ireland and Luxembourg was essential, and I am very grateful to the Central Bank of Ireland and the authorities in Luxembourg for helping us to respond effectively.
There have been important lessons from the LDI episode, which are increasingly relevant in the context of the increased market volatility we have seen in recent weeks following the US announcement on trade tariffs last month. Together, working with other UK regulators, the Central Bank of Ireland and the authorities in Luxembourg, we have taken action to build resilience in LDI funds. And I hope this close cooperation can continue as we seek to navigate another two way street by building more resilience into money market funds in the EU and the UK, as we strengthen our domestic rules.
The benefits of open financial markets as well as the dependencies also tend to go both ways.
The UK and EU are both seeking to strengthen our domestic capital markets. The EU’s Savings and Investment Union agenda and the UK government’s reforms to pensions are both seeking to direct savings towards productive investment. These are important measures, not least given the pressing need for financing some of the common structural challenges we face in the UK and EU – for example, defence and security, demographics, and the technological and climate transitions.
But strengthening domestic capital markets is only part of the story. The scale of investment needed requires access to global capital, supported by open financial markets. The alternative is fragmentation, which we have unfortunately seen in the global economy in recent years, which reduces the size of markets, and makes them inherently less stable. Fragmentation also increases the cost of capital, undermining growth and investment. Financial market openness, built on a foundation of robust global standards and trust, is a much better alternative.
To repeat, open financial markets are a good thing. As with goods trade, open financial markets support economic growth as well as increasing investment and reducing the cost of capital. So the benefits of open financial markets, as well as the dependencies, tend to go both ways, so a two-way street; and working together effectively is the best way.
As such, there is merit in seeking to increase the openness of our financial markets by reducing non-tariff barriers.
The Bank of England and the Central Bank of Ireland enjoy a very strong relationship, which is built on trust and respect, fostered by close cooperation and coordination and a steadfast commitment to shared values and working together in international bodies to promote global standards. And, my strong view is that this type of work benefits the industries that we oversee. The message that I get consistently, and rightly, is that firms want robust but fair and consistent regulatory standards which will support both stability and competition, and set the level playing field on which they operate.
Thank you.

What if things are different? - speech by Clare Lombardelli
In this speech Clare sets out her current view on the outlook for inflation and what this means for monetary policy. She then turns to how scenarios can help monetary policymakers consider how the economy may differ from a baseline and explores some of the issues raised by scenario analysis.
Speech
Good morning. Thank you for inviting me. It’s a pleasure to speak again at the Bank of England Watchers Conference.
Today I’m going to talk about two things: the outlook for inflation and reforms to our monetary policy processes.
My messages are: first, if you consider all the economic news, noise and bumpiness, underlying inflation pressures for the UK economy have continued to fall. So, it is sensible for us to continue our gradual and careful approach to reducing policy restrictiveness, including through another cut in Bank Rate by 25bps last Thursday.
And second, in reforming our monetary policy processes, we are putting risks and uncertainty more explicitly at the centre of our policy framework. This means important roles for scenarios and wider risk considerations alongside the central outlook. We are developing a wider framework and suite of analytical inputs to build uncertainties and risks into our policy deliberations when appropriate.  In that context, I will talk this morning about how we used scenarios in our most recent policy round.
The outlook for inflation
When I spoke at the Watchers conference in November I talked about the disinflation process, the underlying drivers of inflationary pressure, the need to see further progress on that and the expectation that we would. That has broadly played out, allowing restriction to be reduced gradually. Monetary policy is still restrictive and the current stance reflects a balance between the need to continue to squeeze out underlying inflationary pressure and managing the risks of lower demand in the economy. It is preferable to conduct monetary policy in a steady and predictable way, contributing stability to the environment for other economic decision makers. And we have been able to do that over the last year or so.
When thinking about the process of disinflation, my focus is on wages, as they are the largest component of the prices set by domestic services firms, and so a key driver of moves in underlying inflation. Wage growth is still too high to be consistent with inflation at target. Annual growth in private sector regular AWE was 5.9% in February. This is likely to reflect persisting second-round effects from the period of high inflation and the presence of supply constraints generating inflationary pressures. Productivity growth has been very low over the past couple of years (Chart 1) but that hasn’t been reflected in a substantial decline in wage growth. I will say a bit more on this later when I come to discuss alternative scenarios for the economy.
Chart 1: Labour productivity growth has been very weak
Sources: ONS and Bank calculations. Final data points are for 2024 Q4. Underlying output per worker is based on Bank staff’s underlying measures of GDP and employment based on indicator-based models (see Charts 2.8 and 2.12 from May MPR ).
The AWE data are noisy; Bank staff monitor a broader set of indicators and their combined steer for the current rate of underlying wage growth is lower, at 5¼% (Chart 2). And forward-looking indicators point to further progress on disinflation; the Agents’ pay survey has pay settlements at 3.7% by end-2025 and expectations for wage growth from the DMP survey are around 4% by year-end. Importantly, the most recent pay settlements data are consistent with these forward-looking steers (Chart 3); the upcoming settlements will provide important information.
Chart 2: Wage growth higher than target-consistent but gradually easing
Sources: BoE Agents, DMP Survey, HMRC, Indeed, KPMG/REC UK Report on Jobs, Lloyds Business Barometer, ONS and Bank calculations. Measures of private sector wage growth. For more details see footnote to Chart 2.16 in May MPR .
Chart 3: Latest pay settlements consistent with steer from Agents’ survey
Sources: BoE Agents, Brightmine, CIPD, Incomes Data Research, Incomes Data Services, Industrial Relations Services, Labour Research Department, ONS and Bank calculations. Final data points are the three months to February for private sector regular AWE growth, April for BoE settlements database, March for Brightmine settlements and 2025 Q1 for CIPD expected settlements.
If the forward-looking indicators are broadly accurate, that would represent substantial progress by the end of the year. Simple ready-reckoners suggest that wage growth around 3% and potentially a bit higher would be consistent with inflation at target (Table 1), if productivity growth returns to rates of around 0.5-1%. This calculation also assumes import price inflation in line with its historical average – while this would be unlikely in the longer term if global trade were to fragment, it may be a plausible assumption over the coming period given the exchange rate moves we have seen and the potential for trade diversion from reduced exports by the rest of the world to the US.
Table 1: Ready reckoners for target-consistent wage growth
Illustrative estimates of wage growth consistent with 2% CPI inflation, based on reasonable assumptions for medium-term import price inflation and labour productivity growth. Calculations assume an import intensity of 25% for the CPI basket (due to both direct and indirect channels, consistent with average COICOP class import intensity) and constant markups, such that labour and capital costs grow at the same rate.
However, caution remains appropriate. I’ll be more comfortable when I see material deceleration in the data over a longer period.
The picture for services inflation, which is a simple and observable proxy measure for the persistent component of inflation, is broadly similar to that of wages. The absolute rate of services inflation is still too high, with the annual measure at 4.7% in March, but it’s come down from 6% one year ago. Abstracting from volatile items, underlying measures of services inflation have shown modest declines in recent months. But higher-frequency measures have been flatter. So the picture is not entirely reassuring, although we should expect this disinflation to be bumpy. More broadly, looking forward, the evolution of wages should drive services inflation, especially if firms face limited scope to expand margins in an environment of subdued demand.
Most recently, the economic news has been dominated by the US administration’s announcements and their implications for the global trade outlook. Higher tariffs and more uncertain US policies will likely reduce growth and inflation over the policy-relevant horizon because of reduced demand and trade diversion from reduced exports by the rest of the world to the US. The exchange rate movements we have seen further support lower imported inflation to the UK, although exchange rates can shift in response to trade policy news and the evolution of global risk sentiment. In the longer term, if global trade were to fragment, this would reduce output and productivity and would raise inflationary pressures.
Coming into the May policy round I was balanced between holding and cutting rates. Taken together, the combination of further gradual progress on disinflation and the trade developments led me to conclude that a 25bps cut was the appropriate decision for May.
Scenarios
A valuable tool to help us better understand risks and uncertainties and their consequences is scenarios. Scenarios help us to answer ‘what if’ questions – what if the economy doesn’t behave broadly as our central expectation. They are being increasingly used by monetary policymakers and forecasters in response to uncertainties. For example in April the IMF published a forecast and alternative scenarios in its World Economic Outlook . And in its April Monetary Policy Report , the Bank of Canada dispensed with a central forecast altogether publishing two alternative scenarios based on different assumptions for trade tariffs, oil prices and the exchange rate.
Scenarios are one of the tools we are developing and experimenting with at the Bank of England in response to Dr Bernanke’s review ( Bernanke, 2024 ). They are one part of the ambitious reform programme that I’ve previously talked about ( Lombardelli, 2024 ).  That will encompass a much wider range of improvements across our infrastructure, modelling toolkit, use of data, culture and communication.
In our recent policy round we began to explore using scenarios to have a better discussion of the economy and policy. We considered two scenarios, more details of which are given in Box A in our May Monetary Policy Report .
The first scenario explores the risk that demand weakens more than expected. This could be because the chilling effect of trade policy uncertainty has a greater impact on UK investment and consumption. In our central forecast we expect a material fall in the savings rate from its current elevated level of 10½% to 8½% after three years. But if households become significantly more uncertain about the outlook for the economy and their incomes or job prospects, they may hold back spending, in particular on major purchases. Equally firms may reduce or delay investment if uncertainty about how the economy will evolve leads them to doubt whether investment will be profitable.
In this scenario, we also looked at what would happen if the faster build-up of excess supply triggered a quicker unwind of inflation. This was modelled as a steepening of the Phillips Curve, consistent with a looser labour market in which workers accept a lower rate of pay growth and firms reduce prices more rapidly.
In a second scenario, renewed second-round effects on inflation as well as supply constraints in the UK economy generate a more persistent inflationary environment. We explored a scenario where productivity growth doesn't recover after the recent period of weakness and wage growth continues to outpace productivity gains. Alongside this, households and firms’ inflation expectations are more sensitive to the near-term rise in inflation than usual – perhaps because the increase is more concentrated in food and energy prices, which we know are the most salient items, or also because the experience of higher inflation over recent years has made expectations more sensitive to price rises.
The structural mechanism considered here is different to that discussed in the third ‘case’ in the November MPR, where real income resistance drives up wage demands in the context of reduced labour market contestability.
In the May round, the MPC used analysis of these scenarios, their economic mechanisms and policy implications as part of the regular discussions we have on the latest data, the economic outlook, policy and communications. Reflecting on those discussions, I’ll make a few points.
First, these scenarios describe a limited number of specific economic mechanisms. They don’t aim to provide a comprehensive view of risks around the outlook. This is intentional, as it allows us to consider in more detail some of the specific risks some members of the Committee are worried about. Enabling us to think through the macroeconomic implications and the potential consequences for policy. Getting into the economics allows us to think harder about not just how plausible these scenarios are, but also how worried about them we should be.
Second, these scenarios aren’t just about describing the response of the economy and our reaction function to an economic shock or a different conditioning assumption path, as sensitivity analysis would. They do that, and it’s a useful thing. footnote  But we can also use scenarios to help us explore uncertainty around key parameters of the economy; for example, around the relationship between the output gap and inflation (the slope of the Phillips curve) in different states of the world. The first of the May scenarios goes some way towards doing that. We plan to do more of this type of analysis in future.
Third, these are not simple ""downside” and “upside” scenarios. They both explore circumstances in which economic activity is lower than potential. We are not sending a signal about whether we view the growth forecast as optimistic. But by exploring different mechanisms by which activity may be weaker than we expect, we can explore the different consequences for policy. The first scenario describes a negative demand shock, while the second presents a trade-off for the MPC given the inflationary environment and a negative output gap.
The two scenarios are not mutually exclusive. It is possible, and indeed likely, that members may worry about both scenarios or aspects of them. It would be perfectly reasonable to be concerned that productivity growth does not return to pre-Covid levels and also that demand may be more suppressed by trade policy uncertainty. In this way they are not mutually exclusive states of the world that we can assign probabilities to. Nor does it make sense to place Committee members along a “hawkometer” scale from the downside scenario, through the central forecast, to the upside scenario. And there are other dimensions that scenarios may be useful to tease out, like for example preferences for gradualism or activism when setting policy under uncertainty.
Fourth, the calibration of these scenarios inevitably reflects judgment. We could have produced more or less severe scenarios describing these economic mechanisms. For monetary policymaking, scenarios tend to be more useful when they are different from the central case, but still plausible. This differs from scenarios for the analysis of financial stability risks, for example, where it often makes sense to analyse mechanisms that are more in the tails of the distribution of possible outcomes. Both of the scenarios we considered in May are plausible for the UK economy and so helpful in thinking about the possibility that the economy may evolve differently to our central projection.
Fifth, and taking a step back, there is an ongoing debate among policymakers, market participants and academics on how best to use scenarios to inform monetary policy. This is an important area of research. I don’t want to pre-empt how these discussions may evolve, including with my colleagues on the MPC. But in my view, they are a valuable tool to help us build the analysis of uncertainty more explicitly into our framework. In the recent meetings I found it particularly helpful to use scenarios as a vehicle to discuss the ‘robustness’ of different policy choices to alternative economic outcomes, and the extent to which policy might need to respond as we continue to learn about the outlook.
Policy considerations
That fifth point brings me to the last thing I want to talk about today – how we are beginning to think about using scenarios as an input to our policy deliberations. One way in which scenarios can be used in that way is to assess how policy could respond to their macroeconomic implications. Doing this requires an assumption about how monetary policy is set. There are many ways to do this, each with a differing economic rationale and accompanying pros and cons. For example, two common approaches are empirically estimated simple policy rules (such as that of Taylor, 1993 ) and model-consistent ‘optimal’ policy. It is worth emphasising that none of these approaches provides an accurate guide to what policy should do in the real world given the simplifying assumptions used. Indeed, these approaches add further assumptions to our ‘what if’ thought experiments: ‘what if monetary policy responded to this scenario in a mechanical, model-based, manner?’. Nevertheless, such experiments can provide useful inputs to policy deliberations, including by exposing the relevant policy considerations.
In the May round, we used a version of model-consistent optimal policy. This approach is based on some very strong assumptions. These include that the model is linear, that monetary policy is set to minimise a quadratic “loss function”, and that both the private sector and monetary policymaker have full information about each other’s behaviour and the shocks hitting the economy. footnote  Expanding the breadth of our toolkit for policy simulations is one of the key areas we will be pursuing in response to the Bernanke review. For now, this is just one of a number of possible ways of determining policy paths.
Variants of the central projection that assume model-consistent optimal policy have been among the analytical inputs discussed by the MPC for some time. An additional use of such variants is as the reference points for assessing and understanding the policy response in scenarios. footnote
As I explained earlier, the first scenario is characterised by a standard negative demand shock, with a negative output gap and inflation falling materially below target in the absence of a tailored monetary policy response. While the second scenario presents a trade-off for monetary policy, given inflation above target and a negative output gap.
Against this backdrop, Chart 4 shows how the model-based policy responses to the two scenarios would differ. Bank Rate would be almost 50bps lower after 3 years in the lower demand scenario than under the model-based baseline path. And it would be about 25bps higher in the inflation persistence scenario. footnote  In these simulations, monetary policy responds more strongly to the lower demand scenario than to the higher inflation persistence scenario because the policymaker is assumed to place some weight on reducing output volatility in addition to its primary objective of returning inflation to the 2% target. Another way to put this is that a monetary policymaker will tend to respond more strongly to a demand shock than if they have to confront a trade-off between stabilising inflation and reducing output volatility.
Chart 4: Policy tends to respond more strongly to a demand shock than in the presence of a trade-off
Sources: Bank of England, ONS and Bank calculations. Model-based simulations of the endogenous response of monetary policy to the May forecast and scenarios produced by Bank staff. Chart shows the difference between the endogenous model-based Bank Rate path in the higher persistence and weaker demand scenarios, relative to the endogenous model-based path for the central forecast. The model used to produce these simulations is specified in the Annex to Broadbent (2022) .
We also used the scenarios to consider the robustness of policy to alternative economic outcomes. We used the toolkit I described a minute ago to evaluate outcomes if the policymaker sets policy expecting a baseline outlook, but the economy evolves like in either of the scenarios. This allowed us to discuss the possible costs of policy missteps if the economy ends up evolving in a different way than the expected.
Applying the analysis to the policy decision, it’s consistent with the view that the 25bps reduction to Bank Rate would not lead to large regrets if the economy evolves as in either of the two scenarios. More broadly, the evidence suggests that at 4.25% monetary policy is still restrictive, so if we were to find ourselves in a world with greater inflation persistence than expected, policy would still be providing pressure to squeeze inflation out of the system. And it would be doing that whilst having taken out some insurance against the risk of a larger fall in demand through the 25bps cut in May.
Of course, we will keep experimenting as we continue to work on our response to the Bernanke review. And we are learning from other central banks and economic policymakers. The work of developing and applying scenarios and wider analytical tools and capabilities to think about uncertainty in a shock-prone world is an essential part of our reform programme. I’ve shared some of our early lessons today, this will not be the last word, far from it.

This is necessary for isolating the policy implications of the scenario, since a comparison between a scenario constructed under model-based policy and the market-conditioned baseline would include the effects of different assumptions about both economic shocks (and the mechanisms through which they transmit to the economy) and the behaviour of monetary policy.

These differences in policy paths should not be interpreted as implying an expectation that the market-implied path for Bank Rate would adjust by similar amounts if either scenario were to come to pass. First, applying the same assumptions about policy in the baseline forecast implies a different path for rates than the market path. Second and more importantly, as already noted, these policy responses are mechanical responses based on several strong assumptions. As a result, they do not capture all relevant considerations for real-world policymaking.

Data governance to set us free − speech by James Benford
Data governance helps organisations protect and maximise the value of data. It helps solve collective problems, especially in complex institutions. James speaks about three areas: a data strategy to align around priorities; coherent management of data and information; and enabling innovation with AI. He talks through how the Bank of England does this, and how a collaborative and inclusive culture and a deliberate yet humble approach play a part in doing it well.
Speech
Introduction
Good afternoon.
It’s a pleasure to be here today to talk about data governance.
Governance helps tackle collective challenges - that no individual person or team can solve alone.
One of the biggest challenges is alignment. When teams are aligned around common priorities, progress is rapid. When they are not, progress stalls.
Consider investment decisions - data platforms, the care spent organising data, structured training. These are all public goods. And like any public good, they are vulnerable to underinvestment and the tragedy of the commons.
Governance is critical to managing change. Data come with legal and ethical obligations. But how do we meet those standards while remaining open to innovation?
Governance challenges go back centuries. But with vast data networks, distributed decisions, and powerful tools like AI, the stakes have never been higher. footnote
The Bank of England is no stranger to them. Like many organisations, we are still on a journey to make the best possible use of data. footnote  footnote  Today, I would like to explore the contribution that data governance can make across three dimensions.
Aligning around a cohesive strategy .
Guiding consistency in how data are managed .
Enabling innovation, in particular the expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) .
We have by no means cracked it at the Bank. But by being open about our challenges and evolving approach, I hope our experience can help others.
Together, they show what governance makes possible: alignment so that we can deliver; investment to build strong foundations; confidence to innovate and grow.
Data governance to set us free.
The Bank's mission, its people, and the value of data
Before I get into the challenges, I need to tell you a bit about the Bank.
We ensure monetary stability by setting interest rates to meet our inflation target of 2%. We ensure financial stability by regulating UK banks, building societies, insurers and large investment firms to make sure they are being run in a safe way. We manage risks to stability in the financial system and take action when necessary. We produce and circulate banknotes and oversee the smooth running of payment systems. When necessary, we support the financial system by lending to it. When firms face difficulties, we stand ready to resolve them whilst protecting depositors, taxpayers and the wider economy. footnote  footnote
We rely on high-quality data to underpin the decisions we make.
The Bank is unusual due to the enormous breadth of data we need, to gain granular insights into what is happening in the economy, and wider financial system.
We generate some of this data through our own operations – running the country’s payments system, managing the collateral of loan books that banks bring to us and distributing bank notes. Like all organisations, management information on our people and finances are critical for decision making.
But the majority of the data that we rely on comes from outside the Bank.
We collate and publish over 35,000 monetary and financial statistics, including critical benchmarks like SONIA footnote  – the average interest rate in sterling unsecured money markets. We do that through a system of around 30 data collections from over 2,000 reporters. The business of regulation is very data heavy, with the volume of regulatory data collections around an order of magnitude larger. Our largest dataset, from trade repositories, amounts to 100 million rows of new data every day. We also acquire large volumes of data commercially, or through agreements with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and government departments.
Our work with data is distributed right across the organisation. We are a range of highly analytical, data-driven people at the Bank. Each of our teams rely on accurate, timely and trustworthy information to make critical decisions. footnote  Before ten years ago, we had no central data team. Teams across the Bank looked after their data using largely local systems. Our central data area was set up in 2015 to bring more order to things.
A data & analytics strategy that is built together, for everyone
Our first big challenge is how to keep these disparate functions cohesive and coherent in their use of data.
An internal review in 2023, concluded that though we were making good progress in some areas, we needed a new approach. It set out three key areas for action:
Agreeing a clear, shared strategy for data and analytics.
Breaking down institutional, cultural, and technological barriers to connect siloes across the organisation.
Broadening and deepening our investments in people.
In response, we set up a Data and Analytics Board at Executive level, with a representative from each area of the Bank, including our enabling functions. It is chaired jointly between our data and technology areas. We worked together to publish a new strategy and 3-year roadmap in July last year.
The strategic objectives we are working towards drive three key benefits for the organisation: efficiency, effectiveness and risk reduction. We measure things quantitatively – the value of time saved – and qualitatively – drawing on surveys of user experience and risk reporting.
We have three missions framing the capabilities that we needed to build to get there: making it easy to work with and analyse data; bridge data gaps to increase the value of data we collect and share; enable safe and effective innovation, including AI
And those missions are underpinned by two foundations: a new data platform on the cloud, and data fluency training for all.
Our motto is change that is “built together, for everyone”. footnote
We agreed principles footnote  to guide a common approach, with colleagues in technology drawing up a consistent target data and technology architecture. We set up a dedicated data portfolio bringing together our major programmes of change into a new Data Transformation Programmes division.
Business-facing programmes are led by local needs but build capabilities the whole organisation can use on a common foundation, our new enterprise data platform on the cloud.
A dedicated data design authority keeps us aligned. We have established a team of data business partners to work with business areas to understand their priorities, and identify challenges and opportunities.
Cloud for data: We have set up a new, secure environment to safely work with data on the cloud. Development areas have been provisioned for our priority programmes and exemplar use cases.
Skills and culture: We have designed and launched new data fluency foundation training, aimed at all roles, integrating within graduate and experienced hire inductions, and put in place more in-depth apprenticeship programmes from school leaver to Master’s level.
Making it easy to work with data: We have taken steps to simplify our governance policies and mapped all our data. That mapping is being used to organise the Bank into domains, which will take ownership of the data they are expert in and make it available to meet the needs of the organisation as a whole. We have an agreed design now for one of our priority applications on our data platform – an environment for economists to work in, supporting monetary policy. The build of that environment is about to start. It will go live in the middle of next year, and we expect to have migrated key processes - including production of forecasts - by Spring 2027. Broader priorities are being met, with new products ranging from a people insights dashboard to a supervisory dashboard emerging.
Closing data gaps, including how we share data externally: We have moved our statistical data onto the cloud and have built a new application to interrogate it. It is already improving the quality of our data. In time it will allow us to realise efficiencies and improve how we make the data available publicly. Our Transforming Data Collection team won an award for work last year to make life easier for reporters by improving the information we make available to them. We are now agreeing with industry how we can best streamline regulatory data collections from banks. More broadly, we have moved to an enterprise model for our commercial acquisitions, unlocking over £1 million of value for us annually, and begun to broaden our connections to administrative data in government.
Enabling safe and effective innovation, including AI: We have trialled the use of AI assistants, and had our first roll out with over 1,000 colleagues using general assistants and around 300 using coding assistants. We have also assembled a portfolio of bespoke AI applications, a number of which are now going into production. This work is helping to shape requirements for how we manage unstructured data.
We have an agreed model to measure the efficiency benefits on our data programmes and will soon launch a new annual Data & Analytics survey to assess whether the strategy is working for everyone.
For me, the single most important factor for success on any given dimension has been strong alignment around clear, resourced priorities. An inclusive and collaborative culture is completely critical for that. Bringing together our big pieces of change into a common portfolio, having the right multi-disciplinary teams and a strong partnership between technology and data have all been critical for cohesion. Building broader partnerships based on mutual trust is being greatly helped by our data business partners. The team has catalysed the setting out of local data strategies in a common language and run vital Data and AI ‘Connect’ sessions to promote a shared understanding of how these fit with plans in the centre.
Inevitably, no plan survives the test of time. The landscape can change and priorities shift. This is normal and, when it happens, initiatives must stay aligned to strategic outcomes. Managing programmes as a portfolio and being clear on dependencies helps keep decisions coherent, particularly for foundational components. More broadly a clear focus on business outcomes is critical. Yes, there is a need to improve data fluency across organisations, but business fluency in the data teams is just as important.
Governing data management: Maturing from giving instructions to defining a central service
Our journey to the cloud is giving us the chance to revisit our approach to data management. It is complex to get right in a federated set up, but core to our first mission to make it easy for everyone to work with data.
Four central teams – an analytics enablement hub, a data management hub, a data collection hub, and a skills and culture hub – are critical to the cohesive system we are trying to build.
Our Analytics Enablement Hub acts as a one-stop shop for consultancy and advice relating to analytics and visualisation tools in the Bank. It has now partnered on 40 projects with over 30 different teams. These range from automating manual Excel processes to developing new tools using Language Models. It also helps areas understand the analytical underpinning of their core business processes. The hub has also supported teams to set up big data projects on our on-premise data platform. That includes, for example, transaction level data on derivatives and securities financing, loan-level data on mortgage lending, and company-level data on balance sheets and profitability.
As well as maturing our analytical work, the hub itself has improved the quality of the documentation and meta-data around the datasets involved.
Our Data Management Hub leads the Bank in making our data easy to find and use, by defining what needs to be done, who is responsible, and providing services to support them. The hub also engages with owners of datasets across the Bank, to ensure they are properly documented. Over 2,000 datasets are now registered. This has proved harder to get right, and I will come onto the lessons there in a moment.
It runs the Bank’s Reference and Master Data Management (MDM) service, ensuring oversight of our most critical and widely used datasets. The initial customer was our markets and banking area, ensuring we had a single trusted source of the truth on our counterparties, and on data like exchange rates and bond prices - critical for valuing our positions. But since it was set up, we have broadened the service to capture needs across the organisation, further enriching counterparty information and geospatial data, such as enhancing analysis on the impact of flooding on UK firms. footnote  The team has automated the daily process to measure the value of Sterling relative to our trading partners. We now cover 2.2 million parties with Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) footnote  , including around 400 Firm Reference Numbers and 70,000 Company Registration Numbers. Next month, we will enhance our published authoritative list of the firms the Bank has authorised with LEIs.
Looking further ahead, we plan to include all 1,300 PRA-regulated firms and an additional 5 million parties from Companies House. We are also working closely with the ONS to improve access to their business register. Doing so would reduce our costs, improve the quality of - and enhance our understanding of - monetary and economic statistics, thus improving decisions supporting monetary and financial stability.
The hub also engages with owners of datasets across the Bank, to ensure they are properly documented. Over 2,000 datasets are now registered. This has proved harder to get right, and I will come onto the lessons there in a moment.
Our Data Collection Hub helps teams follow the right processes for acquiring data from outside the Bank or generating it through a new collection. Its purpose is to make sure we bring in data once and well, then make it available strategically to maximise its value to the organisation. When we design a new data collection, we do so with reference to what we have already, seeking to make use of common standards and to avoid duplication across collections. We extended this service last year to the acquisition of commercial data sets. A stronger, enterprise-wide approach here has already generated over £1 million of value annually and we expect that to increase further.
Our Skills and Culture Hub’s data fluency initiative empowers everyone to speak a common language when working with data, supporting colleagues to work confidently with data across its lifecycle. It curates a set of self-led online training courses available to all, including a data and AI fluency foundation that is recommended for all. It runs instructor-led sessions in more technical areas like coding. We delivered 1500 training places through our community of data scientists over the past year. Looking ahead, we are looking to build stronger career pathways for those in data roles and build a stronger profession.
Overall, the various central functions we have set up are working well. They are maturing in depth and breadth. In some areas - including how we bring data into the building; master and reference data; and curating learning resources - greater central control is demonstrably driving more value. Our central analytics hub has been great at driving value and building skills by spreading best practice.
But there are two areas where we have struggled and have further to go.
The first is achieving sufficient consistency in the management of datasets across the Bank, including those that are not managed centrally. It is a classic collective action problem. It benefits everyone to have datasets that are easy to find, understand and relate to each other. But where responsibilities are distributed, that outcome can be harder to achieve.
A second area is managing our data collections across the financial sector. In some ways, that creates a similar collective problem at a different scale. High quality statistics and regulatory data rely on consistent flows of data from over 2,000 reporters in the financial system. Many hands and many machines are involved in that supply chain. The costs involved are substantial.
Across both the core challenge is: How best to manage data collectively to maximise its value?
Internally, an important lesson has been to view data management as a federated service.
This entails a shift from data management being a ‘governance’ activity – something people did because we pushed them to do it – to a service-driven activity – something people do because they want to.
We worked with our User-Centred Service Design team to agree an underpinning set of principles to get buy-in across the organisation on the purpose of, and facets to, good data management.
The overarching principle is that data are valuable, shared assets. We can maximise value by making data widely available, easy to use and understand, whilst ensuring data are protected and not misused.
Bringing the service to life means getting four things right:
First , a proportionate vision for service maturity. All data need to have basic information registered. But where data are widely used or feed into critical processes, it becomes instrumental to dedicate resources to supporting ease of access, use and quality for our users. We are increasingly tending toward managing these assets centrally.
Second , the assignment of clear responsibilities across the federation. We are working through which datasets will be managed centrally and which will be managed by teams across the Bank that are expert in them. Importantly, even where data is managed locally, it still needs to take into account the broader needs for it across the Bank.
Third, establish and mature support functions in the centre. Federated teams managing their own data draw on the data management hubs ‘registration’ service to publish their data. Those looking for data draw on its ‘find’ service.
Fourth , establish priorities. We have already identified priorities through our cloud journey and so are focusing on re-defining how our federation works for those customers first. We are also looking at how we tag our documents as we move them to the cloud, with an eye to our AI use cases.
Externally, an important feature to our approach is to establish a strong collaboration with industry and partner regulators. We have a joint transformation programme with the Financial Conduct Authority, to exploit synergies and enable a consistent approach. We have an advisory board from industry to oversee what we do, and an Industry Data Standards Committee to make recommendations on reporting standards. Engagement with industry has been critical to our well-received work to improve instructions on statistical returns.
The overall scale of the task is substantial.
A survey we ran last year suggested reporting cost the UK banking system is £1.5-2.0 billion per annum. Our work to reduce those costs is an important contribution to the PRA’s secondary competitiveness and growth objective. We will secure quick wins this year by deleting a first swathe of redundant regulatory collections and introducing a new portal to facilitate firms’ interactions with the PRA, starting with the authorisations process. We will see if there are redundancies in our statistical collections too. At the same time, we will be building a joint vision with the firms that we collect from on how to take further costs out. Alongside dropping collections, this will likely entail work to make instructions clear through integrated data standards and steps to streamline the processes. We are consulting firms, starting with a meeting of Chief Financial Officers next week, on the interventions that will be most impactful for them.
Governing Artificial Intelligence
My last area is Artificial Intelligence.
With the latest wave of advancements, particularly in Generative AI, we’re seeing four fundamental shifts that signal not just progress, but a revolution in how we harness data and build solutions. This time it is different.
First, there’s the enormous step change in the power and complexity.
The Bank’s core central macroeconomic forecasting model contains 175 parameters. In contrast, the largest AI models count over 405 billion parameters.
These models can adapt to an incredibly broad range of new tasks and power complex applications. footnote
But it can be very difficult to understand and explain their inner workings. They risk becoming the ultimate ‘black boxes’.
Second, all data are now in scope.
AI models can process numbers, text, video, sound, and images, often all at once.
Data from our interactions with AI systems can help to shape their future behaviours – creating an increasingly dynamic, but also increasingly complex, interaction between humans and machines.
This raises issues around acceptable use: whose data are we using and does the use meet legal requirements and ethical standards?
Third everyone can use them.
AI solutions now supply the capability of interacting in natural language. Everyone can use them. It’s why our Governor, Andrew Bailey, described it as having the hallmarks of a general-purpose technology – the kind of technology that reshapes how we work. footnote
Wider access brings opportunity – but also risk. Without clear standards, guidance, or the right skills in place, we risk creating blind spots and unintended consequences.
Fourth, everyone can be a builder of AI solutions.
People are now also able to use AI to build their own solutions, or agents, tailored to suit their own workflows.
This could change the productivity of transformation work itself: accelerating change, quickly unlocking the automation of workflows. Where we allow agents to take actions on our behalf, we are at least changing the position of humans in the loop. Care is needed to understand the broad systems we are building and ensure we are able to manage them at both an individual and an organisational level.
I will touch briefly on how our use of AI is changing. We have found from our roll out of AI assistants, that time savings for the general users are 5-10%. For those who do a lot of work in code, or manage a lot of correspondence, they can be substantially larger.
Writing code with the help of AI is accelerating our transformation efforts . The code that powers our 35,000 statistics has built up over two and a half decades. Each aggregate is a complex system of equations. Moving that onto our new cloud platform would have taken several months of work by hand. With AI generating modern code and testing it has been cut down to days.
We have built quite a few variants of chatbots . We’ve fed query correspondence history into AI tools to curate FAQ documents that can then guide suggested answers. And we’ve built a tool that will allow everyone in the Bank to query our many corporate policies, lifting the load on our compliance team.
Our most involved and complex applications are trying to put more shape around how we capture, process and store information from unstructured sources .
One application is the conversations we have with firms to monitor the economy, where we are building an application that allows a summary of key themes, and the drilling into what has been said about particular issues, whilst protecting sensitive information.
A second relates to the vast amounts of unstructured data on the firms that we supervise – their disclosures, analyst reports, their internal board and risk packs – with a structured workflow using AI to extract summary reports, highlighting areas for deeper investigation.
We are now looking at how we scale innovation with AI to take full advantages of the latest tools on offer.
Which leads us to our third and final challenge:
How do we adapt our governance approach to AI, to enable safe and effective innovation?
We started by describing seven the principles underpinning our use of AI, to support decision-making at scale – what it means for AI systems to be TRUSTED: footnote
T argeted. We must focus tightly defined use cases, tied to our strategy and mission, and generating measurable value.
R eliable. We aim for reliable AI systems that perform to a high standard and are grounded in high-quality data. For load bearing applications, we seek to constrain or at least reference model outputs to high quality data that we trust. In some cases, this means using smaller models to do the work.
U nderstood. AI systems, and the data that underlie them, need to be transparent and comprehensible. Training is critical.
S ecure. We proactively address potential threats, through clear terms of use, robust security measures, and privacy controls.
T ested. We conducting robust testing, discuss and document risks, and put mitigants in place.
E thical. Now that there are so many more possibilities for leveraging data, the question of what is the right and ethical thing to do is all the more important. Clear frameworks are required here.
D urable. We focus on creating sustainable AI systems, where the benefits exceed the costs.
First, we have put in place an Artificial Intelligence Policy to make clear how to use AI responsibly, what to do and who to reach out to for advice. It is there to enable teams to make their own decisions on the use of AI tools, rather than to draw all decisions to a bottleneck in the centre.
Second, we have also drawn up a Data, Analytics and AI Ethics Framework to outline the foundational principles, incorporating ethics, that we have regard to when we work and innovate with data and analytics, including AI. It includes a tool to allow a self-assessment of a use case and guide to escalation.
Third, we are developing an Artificial Intelligence Strategy to guide prioritisation of central support to scale. Our approach prioritises quick routes to efficiency gains and favours blended teams across data, technology and business areas.
Fourth, we have established an Artificial Intelligence and Data Ethics Committee , to govern once and well. This committee meets once a month so we can make progress rapidly. Again, it is jointly between data and technology.
Fifth, we recently launched a Bank-wide Data Fluency Foundation , which includes AI. We are building on this with a curated library of training on AI, a lot of which is freely available, and are setting up knowledge-sharing channels. As we further roll out AI assistants, we are looking at what of our AI training to make mandatory.
Our AI policy comprises of five elements. There is a list of approved tools with prescribed uses
There are certain tools that are prohibited and certain business activities where we do not use AI.
We do not use AI to make decisions .
The use of AI in the Bank is guarded by our AI Policy and other existing policies. We also have an AI Ethics Framework which staff can use to judge whether that they are seeking to do is safe. We use this Framework to test out riskier use cases of AI, e.g. when using AI on sensitive data. Innovation through AI needs to be:
Beneficial and scientifically rigorous
Fair and inclusive
Transparent and secure
Compliant and accountable
To help colleagues apply these principles, we are giving them a self-assessment tool, to review it from an ethics standpoint.
We need to accommodate change … because AI is moving quickly. Tools are coming online now to enable the whole organisation to get involved in the development of AI tools. We are looking at what is sensible here but are taking our time. Scaling citizen development safely and effectively requires clear guardrails, the right operating model between technology, data and the business, as well as a strong focus on training.
That may sound like a lot of governance. But this is governance to enable and be deliberate about change. Our experience showed that, without clear direction and guardrails, uncertainty on what is allowed and how to get decisions can stifle innovation.
Conclusion
To other organisations navigating their data governance journey, I offer three final thoughts:
First, success in any strategy rests as much in culture as it does in content.
Particularly for data, the best chance of success comes through collaboration and inclusion: a data strategy that is built together for everyone . Inclusive decision-making, business partner teams to connect, and an approach that empowers by equipping teams in the business with the access, tools and skills they need are critical ingredients.
I would also advocate for humility . Each of the challenges we've faced on our journey to make the best possible use of data has required us to pause, reframe, and design with the end-user in mind. And whilst we have made meaningful progress, we are still very much on that journey. We won't solve everything in one go. But by staying transparent, engaged externally and open to learning – we can better prepare for the future, not just react to it.
Finally, I’d encourage you to see governance as the lever through which we exercise agency over our collective future . Done right, it holds us together so that we can deliver. It ensures we build systems that serve everyone. It gives us the confidence—and the courage—to innovate, to adapt, and to grow. It means the future is not something we await. It’s not something that the models have predicted for us. It’s something we shape.
And that’s why, done right, data governance doesn’t hold us back.
It sets us free.

The courage not to act − remarks by Huw Pill
In this speech, Huw discusses why he voted to leave Bank Rate unchanged at the May MPC meeting.
He characterises that vote as favouring a ‘skip’ within a continuing withdrawal of monetary policy restriction, rather than a halt to the process of withdrawal itself. Huw argues that, while the underlying disinflation process remains intact, the quarterly pace of 25bp Bank Rate cuts seen since last summer is too rapid given the inflation outlook – in line with his preference for a “cautious and gradual” pace for the withdrawal of policy restriction over the past year.
This caution derives from Huw’s concern that structural changes in price and wage setting behaviour have increased the intrinsic persistence of the UK inflation process. He illustrates these concerns and their implications for monetary policy  using a simple model of the UK macroeconomy that incorporates – in contrast to the standard Bank of England models used to construct the baseline forecast and scenarios presented in the MPC’s latest Monetary Policy Report – a role for ‘real income resistance’ in price and wage determination. Scenarios based on this model helped develop and explain his MPC vote.

Monetary policy in uncertain times - speech by Andrew Bailey
Speech
I suspect it will be little news to the inhabitants of an island in the middle of the North Atlantic that we live in a world where big shocks can challenge the way we go about our lives and force us to adapt, build resilience and be ready to act.  On some days, an icy wind blows from the North under a clear blue sky.  On others, Autumn’s dismal rain moves in from the South under a sky packed tight with clouds.  Occasionally, tectonic plates shift, and volcanos erupt.  I am not going to belabour the metaphor.  Suffice to say that we live in a world where big economic shocks can test the strength and resilience of the framework for monetary policy.
In the United Kingdom, where the weather can be to say the least variable – as here in Iceland – that monetary policy framework is inflation targeting.  It is well-established and has proved its worth.  The numerical inflation target and an independent Monetary Policy Committee with a diversity of views, expertise and experience, supported by expert analysis from staff, has been fundamental in anchoring inflation expectations and delivering price stability.
In the early days after inflation targeting was first established in the 1990s, however, the world was a different place.  It was the ‘NICE’ (or ‘Non-Inflationary and Consistently Expansionary’) period, according to one of my predecessors – a time when, on the whole, fluctuations in economic activity were driven by small shocks to aggregate demand against a backdrop of a steadily expanding supply side. footnote  These were mild days of warm breezes and springlike rain.
In this world, monetary policy could no doubt be challenging, but the setting was reasonably predictable.  Central to MPC deliberations at the time was to form a clear view of the outlook for aggregate demand in the 1-2 years ahead and set interest rates in a forward-looking manner such that it aligned with aggregate supply.  In this way, inflationary pressures would be kept in check, and the economy could grow along a sustainable path with consumer prices rising at the target rate.  This was a world that lent itself to one central projection as the basis for policy deliberations and to communicate the inflation and policy outlook to the outside word – with the central paths positioned within fan charts thereby rightly avoiding any suggestions of a spurious degree of precision. footnote
The global financial crisis was the first major test of this approach.  Demand was certainly affected in this episode, by uncertainty and the loss of wealth and income, but it was not the only part of the economy to suffer.  The supply side of the economy was affected too, and sharp exchange rate moves affected imported inflation directly.  Inflation targeting had to adapt to recognise and manage evident trade-offs between the speed with which inflation was brought back to target and the balance between aggregate demand and supply in the transition.
In the United Kingdom, this was expanded in the annual remit letter from the Government to the Bank of England in 2013.  The remit recognises that there are circumstances in which returning inflation to target as quickly as the lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism allow could cause undesirable volatility in economic activity and employment.  Expanding this to large and persistent shocks was a sensible change, and ‘trade-off management’ was subsequently deployed in the response to the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union. footnote  But it did not fundamentally change the way the MPC went about its business, with a central projection and a fan chart around it derived from past forecast errors at the centre of its policy deliberations and communication.
Over the last five years, the world has been very different, certainly compared to the tranquil years before the global financial crisis.  As my former colleague Ben Broadbent put it, we went from NICE to NaSTY (‘Not-AS-Tranquil Years’). footnote  Whatever we call this period, a sequence of unprecedented global shocks has created a very challenging environment for monetary policy.  The largest pandemic in a century, the largest war in Europe since 1945, and now a trade war between the world’s two largest economies – these are not small and simple disturbances to aggregate demand, and they come against a backdrop of low productivity growth and ageing populations.  While it remains to be seen how recent changes to global trade policies will play out and what the effects on our economies will be, the effects of the pandemic and Russia’s brutal war on the Ukrainian people are fresh in our minds.  Our economies have suffered, inflation has surged.  These have been hard times for businesses and households, not least those on lower incomes.
As the economic effects of these shocks have faded and inflation has come down, we do also have a positive story to tell.  The nominal anchor has remained intact.  Inflation targeting – through forceful action to lean against second-round effects from the global shocks on domestic price and wage setting with a restrictive monetary policy stance – is working to return inflation sustainably to target.  It is testament to the strength and resilience of this framework that we can say we are on course to put the inflation surge firmly behind us.
This is not to sound complacent.  We must learn the lessons from the difficulties we have faced as policymakers and forecasters over this period.  Our models, infrastructure and analytical frameworks were challenged by the sheer scale and unpredictability of the shocks that hit us.  Underlying issues were revealed under the stress of these big unforeseeable events.  Forecasting became much more difficult, irrespective of the specific models and approaches used.  We need no reminder that the global economic environment is likely to continue to be challenging – and less predictable – than it was in the past.  So we need to adapt and develop to ensure that our processes are nimble and robust, and that our monetary policy decisions are communicated effectively, while ensuring that we continue to act methodically in response to inflationary pressures.
That is why, in the Summer of 2023, we asked Ben Bernanke to lead an independent review into the Bank of England’s forecasting and related processes during times of significant uncertainty.  We are very grateful to him for having taken on this work and for the dedication he put into it.  As you would expect, the review Dr Bernanke published in April last year was a thorough and carefully conducted assessment of the relationship between our projections, monetary policy decisions, and their communication.  It has been an excellent catalyst for a comprehensive programme of change.
There are many practical elements to this work.  In the year since the report, we have made substantial investments to continue to develop key parts of the Bank’s model and data infrastructure.  A significant programme is in train to deliver a state-of-the-art environment for working with data on the cloud, and to update our systems for accessing, analysing and visualising data accordingly.  We have updated our core structural macro model to better capture the transmission of energy price shocks and to tackle the extreme data outturns of the pandemic period.  And we are widening our suite of models including heterogenous agents, machine learning and threshold vector-autoregressive models as well as a new semi-structural model.  Work is underway to bring this together in a modelling and data environment with enhanced capabilities for forecasting and policy analysis.
But more broadly, the challenge we face is to adapt our processes so that they assign more prominence to risks and welcome challenge to underlying assumptions, drawing on a wider range of analysis and exploring different economic shocks and mechanisms through which they affect the economy, while ensuring that it continues to serve to maintain the nominal anchor that is the Alpha and the Omega of inflation targeting.
The UK setup with an MPC with nine individually accountable members, each with an equal vote in monetary policy decisions, was never a good match for a single core model and a single central projection summarising one view of the outlook.  Policy discussions on the MPC are open, frank and lively – as they should be.  Expert views are exchanged, assumptions investigated, and questions posed.  Three-way splits are not unheard of.  I can honestly say that there is no groupthink on the MPC.
This is a system with great strengths.  Diversity of expertise and experience, combined with expert knowledge, makes for better decisions given the complexity of monetary policy.  Differences of views are inevitable consequences of the uncertainty we face.  But equally, behind a split vote is often a high degree of communality on the qualitative factors shaping the outlook and the broad implications for the policy stance.
In agreeing on a central projection, the MPC has historically come together by forming what has long been described as its ‘best collective judgement’.  This is a view of the outlook that all members can sign up to as reflecting the balance of views on the Committee.  But exactly what the ‘best collective judgement’ is meant to represent has been left undefined and ambiguous, open for discussion and negotiation.  Embracing this ambiguity has been the way the MPC has reconciled individual accountability with the approach of formulating monetary policy through a central projection for the economy and inflation.
Dr Bernanke challenged us to reconsider this approach, and instead of only deliberating our way towards a ‘best collective judgement’ of a central case to add alternative scenarios to our policy making process and communication.  That, he said, would “help the public better understand the reasons for the policy choice, including risk management considerations”.
In response, as my colleague Clare Lombardelli set out in a speech last Autumn, we have been building scenarios into our processes, framed within a broader discussion of risks to the outlook. footnote  And we have started to see the benefits.
Scenarios have helped us not only to explore what would happen in case a particular shock, or constellation of shocks, should hit the economy, but also how any given set of shocks could affect the economy and inflation depending on the strengths of different economic mechanisms.  And it has helped us consider how monetary policy should respond in different states of the world – or with a different balance of risks – as well as the implications of setting policy as if we are in one state of the world when in fact we are in another.  These are considerations that enrich monetary policy deliberations.
In the Monetary Policy Report published yesterday, we presented two alternative scenarios along with a baseline projection.  In the first scenario, global and domestic uncertainty could weigh on UK demand to a greater extent than in the baseline, in turn easing inflationary pressures.  In the second scenario, recent energy price rises could lead to new second-round effects on domestic prices and supply could be more constrained, in turn increasing inflationary pressures.
These scenarios are meant to convey more than mere upside and downside risks to inflation.  By setting out the mechanisms behind them, they explore why inflation may take a different path.  And from a policy perspective, it matters whether inflation differs from the baseline because of demand or supply.  Even if the difference in inflation is of a similar magnitude on the downside and on the upside, the size of the required monetary policy response might not be.  A demand-driven downside scenario is likely to require a larger monetary policy response than a supply-driven upside scenario, simply because there is more of a trade-off to balance when inflation and activity move in different directions.  These are nuances that an articulation of the mechanisms behind the scenarios can help us bring out and clarify in our communication.
But the choice of these two scenarios – proposed by Bank staff – should not be taken to mean that MPC members, individually or collectively, put a larger weight on a downside risk to inflation from demand and an upside risk in inflation from supply than the opposite constellation with an upside risk from demand and a downside risk from supply.  Nor should it be taken to mean that inflation risk is skewed in one direction or the other, or that we see the risks to the path for Bank Rate to be skewed.  The scenarios are only two examples from many possible paths the economy could take.  That is important to emphasise.
What the scenarios also do, by exploring important judgements underlying the projection, is to serve as articulations of elements of the outlook that individual MPC members can use to position themselves within our material.  This is an additional benefit in the UK context where MPC members are individually accountable for their votes and are expected to explain their positions to the wider public.  Scenarios, combined with a broader set of analysis, can help support the explanation of alternative views without the need to sign up to a ‘best collective judgement’.
This is the direction of travel for our monetary policy communication.  We are moving away from one central projection reflecting the ‘best collective judgement’ of the MPC, set within fan charts to illustrate risks around it.  This was a good approach in a world where fluctuations in activity and inflation were largely driven by relatively small disturbances to demand.
But it does not work as well in the world we now live in where we are exposed to big shocks to supply as well as demand – and in particular in a context where individual members of a policy committee are individually accountable for their decisions.  So instead, we are putting greater weight on the key judgements behind our view of the outlook, emphasising the underlying economics as much as precise numbers, and framing our discussions within a broader discussion of risks and drawing on a wider range of analysis.
We will maintain a baseline projection, based on a staff proposal, one that a majority of the MPC agrees is a reasonable baseline, rather than one that meets an elusive notion of the MPC’s ‘best collective judgement’.  And we will use scenarios as vehicles for exploring risks around the baseline and accommodating differences of views on the Committee.
Over time the scenarios we look at will evolve as our capabilities advance.  And as we build out the scenarios, we will be able to develop the explanation about how we have factored them into monetary policy decisions.  So our public communications will evolve along with this process.
These changes that will help us build resilience into our inflation targeting framework and secure the nominal anchor for the future, whatever it may bring, come wind or rain.  Our commitment to the 2% inflation target is unwavering.
