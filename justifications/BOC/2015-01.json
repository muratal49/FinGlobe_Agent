The communication from the Bank of Canada for January 2015 signals a cautious and responsive approach to recent economic developments, particularly the dramatic drop in oil prices. The Bank acknowledges the significant impact of the decline in oil prices, attributing it to a surge in unconventional oil supply and slower global demand growth. This indicates that the Bank is closely monitoring external economic conditions that could affect the Canadian economy.

The communication suggests a dovish stance, which in macroeconomic terms means that the Bank is more concerned about economic weakness and is likely to adopt policies that support economic growth. This is evident from the Bank's decision to act preemptively by considering a rate cut, which is typically a measure to stimulate economic activity. The Bank states, "the possibility of a rate cut had begun to enter markets," indicating that they are open to lowering interest rates to counteract the negative effects of the oil price shock.

Furthermore, the Bank expresses a commitment to bringing the Canadian economy back to its potential and returning inflation to its 2 percent target. This reflects a focus on supporting economic growth and ensuring price stability, which are key objectives of a central bank. The communication also reassures that the Bank has the tools to respond to whatever economic challenges may arise, suggesting a readiness to take further action if necessary.

In summary, the communication emphasizes the Bank's concern about the economic impact of falling oil prices and its willingness to take measures to support the economy, such as considering a rate cut. This indicates a dovish stance, as the Bank prioritizes economic growth and stability in the face of external shocks.
