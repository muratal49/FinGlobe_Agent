The communication from the Bank of Canada in April 2015 provides insights into the central bank's assessment of both the global and domestic economic conditions and their implications for monetary policy. The Bank of Canada highlighted that the global economy was expected to improve throughout the year, but noted increased economic divergence among countries. This divergence was leading to different monetary policy approaches across the globe and causing more volatility in exchange rates, with a stronger U.S. dollar as a net result.

Focusing on Canada, the Bank reiterated its earlier assessment from January that lower oil prices would have mixed effects on the Canadian economy. While there could be some positive impacts, the overall effect was expected to be negative, with immediate negative consequences and more uncertain, gradual positive effects. This assessment led the Bank to take precautionary measures in January by reducing the policy interest rate by 25 basis points. This move was intended as "insurance" against the risk of a delayed return to full economic capacity and stable inflation at 2 percent.

The communication expressed concern about economic weakness, noting that the economy likely saw no growth in the first quarter of the year. This was partly attributed to external factors such as a slowdown in the U.S. economy due to severe weather and a port strike, as well as unusual weather conditions in Canada. Despite these challenges, the Bank maintained that the impact of the oil price shock was occurring faster than initially expected.

In terms of monetary policy stance, the communication contains dovish elements, as it emphasizes concerns about economic weakness and the need to support the economy through lower interest rates. The decision to cut the policy interest rate in January and the acknowledgment of no growth in the first quarter highlight the Bank's focus on stimulating economic activity and mitigating downside risks.

Evidence from the text includes phrases such as:
- "the net impact would be negative"
- "we faced a risk that our return to full capacity and stable 2 per cent inflation would be delayed significantly"
- "we took out some insurance against that risk, in the form of a 25-basis-point reduction in the policy interest rate"
- "the economy saw no growth in the first quarter"
- "the impact of the oil price shock is proving to be faster than initially"

Based on the communication, the stance is dovish, as the Bank of Canada is focused on addressing economic weakness and supporting growth through accommodative monetary policy.
