### Long Explanation

The Bank of Canada's communication for October 2017 primarily focused on its approach to inflation targeting and the global economic outlook. The communication emphasized the importance of maintaining low, stable, and predictable inflation as a means to foster confidence in the value of money and to support sustained economic growth, employment gains, and improved living standards. The Bank reiterated its commitment to an inflation-control target, which is set at the 2 percent midpoint of a control range between 1 and 3 percent, and this target is intended to remain in place until December 31, 2021.

The communication highlighted that the Bank's inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, meaning that it is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the 2 percent target. This indicates that the Bank is vigilant about both potential inflationary pressures and deflationary risks, suggesting a balanced approach to monetary policy.

In terms of hawkish or dovish elements, the communication can be seen as neutral to slightly dovish. The emphasis on maintaining inflation at a stable and predictable level, along with the symmetric concern for both rising and falling inflation, suggests that the Bank is not overly concerned about immediate inflationary pressures that would require aggressive tightening of monetary policy. Instead, it is focused on ensuring that inflation remains within the target range over a medium-term horizon of six to eight quarters, which allows for flexibility in response to economic shocks.

**Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements:**
- The communication emphasized the importance of keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable, which is a neutral stance as it does not suggest immediate action to raise or lower interest rates.
- The Bank's symmetric concern about inflation rising above or falling below the target indicates a balanced approach, which is also neutral.
- The mention of returning inflation to target over a horizon of six to eight quarters suggests a cautious and measured approach, leaning slightly dovish as it implies no rush to tighten policy.

**Direct Evidence from the Text:**
- "the best way to foster confidence in the value of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable."
- "Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target."
- "the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six to eight quarters."
