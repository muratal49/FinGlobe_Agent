The communication from the Bank of Canada for April 2018 provides insights into the central bank's assessment of the Canadian economy and its potential future actions regarding monetary policy. The communication suggests that the economy has more capacity than previously thought, and this capacity is expanding at a faster rate. This implies that there is more room for economic growth before inflation becomes a concern. However, the bank also notes that some firms, especially exporters, are operating at full capacity but are hesitant to invest further due to uncertainties such as trade issues, transportation challenges, and skill shortages. This hesitation is seen as a limiting factor for export growth and overall economic capacity.

The communication also addresses inflation, indicating that recent data aligns well with forecasts and suggests that the economy is operating with minimal slack. This consistency gives the bank confidence in its inflation models. Wage growth is another area of focus, with data showing significant increases over the past 18 months, nearing the expected rate for an economy at full capacity. However, the bank acknowledges that recent wage figures are temporarily influenced by minimum wage hikes in some provinces.

A key concern highlighted is the economy's increased sensitivity to rising interest rates due to high household debt levels. As interest rates rise, a larger portion of household income will be needed to service debt, potentially reducing spending on other goods and services and exerting downward pressure on inflation. The bank notes that it will take time to fully assess this issue, especially with new mortgage guidelines affecting the housing market. Nonetheless, the slowing growth of household borrowing is seen as consistent with this concern.

In terms of the stance, the communication contains both hawkish and dovish elements, indicating a mixed stance. On the one hand, the acknowledgment of increased economic capacity and consistent inflation data suggests a more hawkish outlook, as it implies less immediate need for accommodative monetary policy. On the other hand, concerns about investment hesitancy, wage growth influenced by temporary factors, and the potential impact of rising interest rates on household spending suggest a dovish caution.

**Hawkish Elements:**
- "the economy currently has more capacity than we previously thought"
- "Inflation measures... have been behaving very much as forecast"

**Dovish Elements:**
- "firms... are operating at their capacity limits but are hesitating to invest"
- "the increased sensitivity of the economy to higher interest rates, given elevated levels of household debt"

Given the mixed signals, the stance is best described as "mixed." The model score of 0.2941, which is higher than the reference score of 0.0370, suggests a more hawkish interpretation, but the communication itself presents a balanced view with both hawkish and dovish considerations.
