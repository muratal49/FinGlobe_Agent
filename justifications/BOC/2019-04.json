### Long Explanation

The communication from the Bank of Canada for April 2019 provides insights into the central bank's assessment of the economic situation and its monetary policy stance. The Bank of Canada is responsible for managing the country's monetary policy, primarily through setting interest rates, to ensure economic stability and growth. 

In this communication, the Bank of Canada signaled a cautious approach to monetary policy, reflecting concerns about the current economic conditions. The text highlights several key points:

1. **Inflation Targeting**: The Bank of Canada reiterated its commitment to maintaining low, stable, and predictable inflation. It emphasized that its inflation-targeting approach is "symmetric," meaning it is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the 2% target. This indicates a balanced approach to managing inflation risks, suggesting that the Bank is not overly worried about inflation deviating significantly from its target.

2. **Economic Outlook**: The communication acknowledged that the Canadian economy is facing "some headwinds," which implies challenges or obstacles to economic growth. However, it also expressed optimism that the economy will "accelerate in the second half of this year," suggesting that the Bank expects these challenges to be temporary.

3. **Monetary Policy Stance**: The Bank's Governing Council judged that an "accommodative policy interest rate continues to be warranted." This means that the Bank is maintaining lower interest rates to support economic growth, which is typically a response to economic weakness or uncertainty.

4. **Monitoring Economic Indicators**: The Bank is closely monitoring "developments in household spending, oil markets and global trade policy" to assess the factors affecting growth and inflation. This indicates vigilance in responding to changing economic conditions.

5. **Fiscal Policy Impact**: The Bank noted that recent fiscal announcements by the federal government and provinces would lead to a "downward revision for our growth outlook of about 0.2 percentage points in 2020." This suggests that fiscal policy changes are expected to have a slight negative impact on economic growth.

Overall, the communication reflects a cautious and supportive stance, with the Bank expressing concern about economic weakness and maintaining an accommodative monetary policy to support growth. The emphasis on monitoring various economic indicators and the acknowledgment of fiscal policy impacts further underscore the Bank's careful approach.
