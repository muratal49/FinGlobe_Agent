### Long Justification

1. **Communication Signaled:**
   The communication from the Bank of Canada in October 2019 primarily focused on its commitment to maintaining a stable inflation rate. The bank reiterated its inflation-targeting policy, which aims to keep inflation at the 2 percent midpoint of a 1 to 3 percent control range. This policy is designed to ensure economic stability and confidence in the value of money, which in turn supports sustained economic growth, employment gains, and improved living standards. The bank also highlighted the flexibility of its approach, noting that the appropriate time frame for returning inflation to target can vary depending on economic conditions.

2. **Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements:**
   - **Neutral Elements:** The communication emphasized the bank's balanced approach to inflation targeting. By stating that "the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the 2 percent target," it indicates a neutral stance. This means the bank is not currently leaning towards tightening or loosening monetary policy but is instead focused on maintaining stability.
   - **Inflation Concerns:** The emphasis on keeping inflation "low, stable and predictable" suggests that the bank is vigilant about inflation risks, but it does not indicate an immediate concern that would prompt a policy change.
   - **Economic Stability:** The bank's commitment to a "symmetric and flexible" inflation-targeting approach suggests that it is prepared to adjust its policy as needed to respond to economic shocks, but there is no immediate indication of economic weakness or overheating.

3. **Direct Evidence from the Text:**
   - "Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric"
   - "the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the 2 percent target"
   - "the best way to foster confidence in the value of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth"
