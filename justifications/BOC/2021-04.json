  "narrative": "The communication from the Bank of Canada in April 2021 provides insights into the central bank's perspective on the economic recovery and its approach to monetary policy, particularly its quantitative easing (QE) program. The central message is that the Bank of Canada has been actively purchasing assets to stimulate the economy, which has been beneficial in supporting economic recovery. However, given the progress made towards recovery, the bank has decided to adjust the amount of stimulus it is injecting into the economy. This adjustment is based on their assessment of the recovery's strength and durability.\n\nThe communication indicates that if the economic recovery continues to align with or exceed their projections, the need for QE stimulus will decrease over time. This suggests a cautious optimism about the economic outlook, as the bank is prepared to reduce stimulus if conditions improve. However, the bank also emphasizes that any changes to the QE program will be gradual and carefully considered, indicating a cautious approach to withdrawing support.\n\nIn terms of macroeconomic signaling, the communication contains elements that can be interpreted as both cautious and optimistic. The cautious elements are reflected in the bank's commitment to \"gradual\" adjustments and being \"deliberate\" in assessing data and communicating their analysis. This suggests a careful and measured approach to policy changes, ensuring that the recovery is not jeopardized by premature withdrawal of support. On the other hand, the optimistic elements are seen in the bank's acknowledgment of progress towards recovery and the potential for reduced stimulus if the recovery is strong.\n\nHawkish elements, which typically indicate a focus on controlling inflation and reducing stimulus, are present in the bank's readiness to adjust QE if the recovery is strong. This is seen in phrases like \"the economy won\u2019t need as much QE stimulus over time.\" Dovish elements, which emphasize supporting economic growth and maintaining stimulus, are evident in the bank's commitment to \"providing the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery.\"\n\nOverall, the communication suggests a mixed stance. The bank is optimistic about the recovery but remains cautious and deliberate in its approach to adjusting monetary policy.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"month\": \"2021-04\",\n  \"bank\": \"Bank of Canada\",\n  \"stance\": \"mixed\",\n  \"model_score\": -0.7143,\n  \"reference_score\": 0.0556,\n  \"alignment\": \"diverge\",\n  \"summary\": \"The Bank of Canada communicated cautious optimism about the economic recovery, indicating potential reductions in QE stimulus if recovery continues strongly.
