### Long Explanation

The communication from the Bank of England for August 2015 provides insights into the central bank's assessment of the economic situation and its monetary policy stance. The primary goal of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is to achieve a 2% inflation target while supporting growth and employment. In this communication, the MPC decided to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.5% with a majority vote of 8-1. Additionally, the committee unanimously agreed to keep the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion.

**Inflation and Economic Conditions:**
The communication highlights that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation fell to zero in June, which is significantly below the 2% target. The deviation from the target is mainly attributed to low energy, food, and imported goods prices, which account for about three-quarters of the shortfall. The remaining quarter is due to weak domestic cost growth, particularly unit labor costs. This indicates that both external and internal factors are contributing to low inflation.

**Monetary Policy Approach:**
The MPC intends to set monetary policy to ensure that economic growth is sufficient to absorb any remaining slack in the economy, aiming to return inflation to the target within two years. This suggests a cautious approach, as the committee is not rushing to change interest rates despite low inflation, indicating a focus on supporting growth and employment.

**Global and Domestic Economic Outlook:**
The committee projects moderate growth in global demand, with advanced economies expected to grow slightly faster and emerging economies slower than in recent years. However, risks to global growth are skewed to the downside, particularly concerning the euro area and China. Domestically, private demand is expected to remain robust, supported by increased real incomes due to lower food and energy prices and rising wage growth.

**Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements:**
- **Dovish Elements:** The decision to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.5% and the emphasis on ensuring growth to absorb economic slack reflect a dovish stance. The communication acknowledges low inflation and the need to support the economy, indicating a preference for accommodative monetary policy.
- **Neutral Elements:** The communication does not signal an immediate change in policy but rather a steady approach, conditional on a "gently rising path" for interest rates as implied by market yields. This suggests a neutral stance in terms of future policy adjustments.

**Direct Evidence from the Text:**
- "CPI inflation fell back to zero in June."
- "The Committee intends to set monetary policy in order to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb the remaining economic slack."
- "Conditional upon Bank Rate following the gently rising path implied by market yields, the Committee judges that this is likely to be achieved."
- "Risks to global growth are judged to be skewed moderately to the downside."
