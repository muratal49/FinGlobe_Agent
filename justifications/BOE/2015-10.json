### Long Explanation

The Bank of England's communication for October 2015 provides insights into its monetary policy stance and the economic conditions influencing its decisions. The primary goal of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is to achieve a 2% inflation target while supporting economic growth and employment. In this communication, the MPC decided to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.5% with a majority vote of 8-1, and unanimously agreed to keep the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion. This decision reflects a cautious approach, given the current economic conditions.

The communication highlights several key economic indicators. Notably, the twelve-month Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was reported at zero in August, significantly below the 2% target. This low inflation rate is attributed largely to reduced contributions from energy, food, and imported goods prices, as well as weak domestic cost growth. The Bank notes that while labor costs are rising, they are not increasing at a pace that would support the inflation target if current trends persist.

The Bank also acknowledges that core inflation remains subdued at around 1%, influenced by restrained labor cost growth and muted import cost growth. This is partly due to the appreciation of the sterling since mid-2013, which has had a dampening effect on import costs. With inflation below target and some spare capacity likely remaining in the economy, the MPC aims to set monetary policy to ensure growth is sufficient to absorb underutilized resources, thereby supporting domestic cost growth and returning inflation to the target within two years.

The communication outlines opposing influences on growth. On the positive side, UK private domestic demand, particularly consumer spending, has been resilient, supported by real income growth, productivity improvements, supportive monetary policy, and strong business and consumer confidence. On the negative side, fiscal consolidation has restrained activity, and global growth remains below average.

In terms of inflation outlook, the Bank notes that once the effects of past international energy and food price movements dissipate, inflation will depend on the balance between domestic cost pressures and any ongoing external disinflationary pressures.

### Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements

- **Dovish Elements**: The Bank expressed concern about low inflation, noting that "twelve-month CPI inflation was zero in August, well below the 2% target rate." The communication also emphasizes the need to "ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb any remaining underutilised resources," indicating a focus on supporting economic growth and employment.
  
- **Neutral Elements**: The decision to maintain the Bank Rate and the stock of purchased assets suggests a neutral stance, as the Bank is neither tightening nor loosening monetary policy. The communication also notes that "the outlook for growth remains characterised by a number of opposing influences," indicating a balanced view of economic conditions.
