**Long Explanation:**

The Bank of England's communication for February 2016 provides insights into its monetary policy stance and the economic conditions influencing its decisions. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.5% and keep the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion. This decision was unanimous, indicating a strong consensus among committee members.

The communication highlights several key economic factors. First, inflation was significantly below the target of 2%, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation at 0.2% in December. This deviation from the target was primarily attributed to external factors such as a substantial drop in oil prices and the appreciation of sterling, which reduced import prices. The Bank noted that these external factors were the main reasons for the low inflation, rather than domestic economic conditions.

The Bank also expressed concern about subdued domestic cost growth, particularly unit labor costs, which are a measure of the cost of labor per unit of output. This indicates that domestic economic activity was not generating sufficient inflationary pressure to counteract the external deflationary forces.

The communication emphasized the need to balance these external and domestic factors to return inflation to the target. The Bank indicated that trying to offset the external drag on inflation too quickly could lead to unsustainable increases in domestic costs, potentially causing volatility in output and employment.

Global economic conditions were also a concern, with the Bank noting a slowdown in emerging economies and weaker-than-expected growth in the US. Additionally, there were significant declines in risky asset prices and oil prices, which were attributed to supply news and concerns about the global economic outlook, particularly regarding China and other emerging markets.

Overall, the communication signals a cautious approach to monetary policy, focusing on supporting growth and employment while gradually returning inflation to the target. The emphasis on external factors and the risks to global growth suggests a dovish stance, as the Bank is more concerned about economic weakness and the potential negative impacts on inflation and growth.

**Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements:**

- **Dovish Elements:** The communication expressed concern about economic weakness, particularly the "subdued domestic cost growth" and the "slowdown in emerging economies." The Bank's decision to maintain the current monetary policy settings despite low inflation indicates a focus on supporting growth and employment rather than aggressively targeting inflation.
  
- **Neutral Elements:** The Bank's intention to "set monetary policy to ensure that growth is sufficient to absorb remaining spare capacity" suggests a balanced approach, aiming to support the economy without causing undue volatility.

**Direct Evidence from the Text:**

- "CPI inflation stood at 0.2%, almost 2 percentage points below the inflation target."
- "Oil prices were more than a third lower, in sterling terms, than a year earlier."
- "The appreciation of sterling since early 2013 has pulled down on import prices more broadly."
- "Subdued domestic cost growth, particularly unit labour costs."
- "Global growth has fallen back further over the past three months."
- "Developments in financial markets seem in part to reflect greater weight being placed on the risks to the global outlook stemming from China and other emerging economies."
