### Long Explanation

The communication from the Bank of England (BoE) for April 2016 provides insights into the central bank's assessment of the economic environment and its monetary policy stance. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the Bank rate at 0.5% and the stock of purchased assets at £375 billion. This decision was unanimous among the committee members, indicating a strong consensus on the current policy approach.

The communication highlights several key economic indicators and considerations:

1. **Inflation Concerns**: The MPC notes that the twelve-month Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation increased to 0.5% in March, which is still significantly below the target of 2%. The shortfall in inflation is attributed mainly to large drags from energy and food prices. The MPC expects these drags to diminish over the next year. Despite a slight increase, core inflation remains subdued due to factors such as the past appreciation of sterling, weak global inflation, and restrained domestic cost growth.

2. **Balancing Act**: The MPC emphasizes the need to balance the diminishing drag from external factors with expected gradual increases in domestic cost growth. They express caution against attempting to fully offset the external drag in the short run, as it could lead to excessive acceleration in domestic costs, resulting in undesirable volatility in output and employment.

3. **Economic Growth Outlook**: The MPC aims to set monetary policy to ensure growth is sufficient to return inflation to the target in about two years, assuming no further shocks. The broad outlook for activity and inflation appears largely unchanged despite mixed news on global growth prospects. The committee notes that downside risks around Chinese activity have lessened, and while U.S. GDP growth indicators were disappointing in the first quarter, they are more encouraging for the second quarter.

4. **Market Conditions**: The communication mentions that sterling has depreciated further, and risk-free interest rates in the UK and elsewhere have declined. These movements, along with rises in the prices of many risky assets, are expected to support economic activity.

### Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements

- **Dovish Elements**: The communication shows concern about low inflation, which is below the target, and the need to support economic growth. The decision to maintain the current policy settings reflects a cautious approach to avoid excessive volatility in output and employment. The mention of "subdued" global growth and "restrained" domestic cost growth also indicates a dovish tone, as the bank is not in a hurry to tighten monetary policy.

- **Neutral Elements**: The MPC's intention to return inflation to the target in about two years without further shocks suggests a steady, measured approach. The broad outlook for activity and inflation being "little changed" indicates stability in their assessment.
