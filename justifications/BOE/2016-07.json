### Long Explanation

In July 2016, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) communicated its decision to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.5%, with a majority vote of 8-1. One member voted for a rate cut to 0.25%. This decision reflects a cautious approach to monetary policy amidst significant economic uncertainty following the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union (Brexit). The communication signals a strong inclination towards easing monetary policy in the near future, as most members expect monetary policy to be loosened in August, contingent on the absence of a further deterioration in the trade-off between supporting growth and returning inflation to target.

The communication highlights several concerns about the economic outlook. It notes that financial markets have reacted sharply to the Brexit vote, with a 6% fall in the sterling effective exchange rate and declines in both short-term and long-term interest rates. This indicates increased uncertainty and potential economic weakness. The Bank also observes preliminary signs of negative impacts on sentiment among households and companies, with sharp falls in business and consumer confidence measures. Additionally, there are early indications that businesses are delaying investment projects and recruitment decisions, and survey data suggest a significant weakening in expected housing market activity. These factors collectively suggest that economic activity is likely to weaken in the near term.

On the inflation front, the communication notes that twelve-month CPI inflation was 0.3% in May, well below the 2% target, and core inflation measures have been stable at a little over 1%. This indicates that inflationary pressures remain subdued, providing room for potential monetary easing.

**Dovish Elements:**
- The Bank expressed concern about economic weakness, noting "sharp falls in some measures of business and consumer confidence" and "preliminary signs that the result has affected sentiment among households and companies."
- The communication emphasized the potential for monetary policy easing, stating that "most members of the Committee expect monetary policy to be loosened in August."
- The Bank highlighted the low inflation environment, with "twelve-month CPI inflation was 0.3% in May and remains well below the 2% inflation target."

**Neutral Elements:**
- The decision to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.5% was supported by a majority, indicating a cautious approach amidst uncertainty.
- The Bank noted that "markets have functioned well," suggesting that financial stability has been maintained despite the Brexit shock.

Overall, the communication leans towards a dovish stance, as it signals a readiness to ease monetary policy in response to economic uncertainties and subdued inflation.
