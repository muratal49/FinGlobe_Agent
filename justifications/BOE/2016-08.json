**Long Explanation:**

The communication from the Bank of England for August 2016 signals a clear shift towards supporting economic growth in the face of potential economic weakness following the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has implemented a comprehensive package of measures aimed at stimulating the economy. This includes a reduction in the Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 0.25%, the introduction of a new Term Funding Scheme, the purchase of up to £10 billion in UK corporate bonds, and an expansion of the asset purchase scheme for UK government bonds by £60 billion.

The communication highlights several key concerns that have influenced these decisions. Firstly, the Bank expresses concern about the weakened outlook for growth, noting that "the outlook for growth in the short to medium term has weakened markedly." This indicates a recognition of potential economic challenges and a need to bolster economic activity.

Additionally, the Bank acknowledges the impact of the fall in the exchange rate, which is expected to "push up on CPI inflation in the near term." This suggests that while inflation may rise above the target temporarily, the primary focus is on addressing the economic slowdown and ensuring long-term stability.

The Bank also points out that "recent surveys of business activity, confidence and optimism suggest that the United Kingdom is likely to see little growth in GDP in the second half of this year." This further underscores the concern about economic weakness and the need for intervention.

Overall, the communication is dovish in nature, as it emphasizes the need for additional stimulus to support growth and reduce spare capacity in the economy, even at the cost of temporarily exceeding the inflation target. The Bank is prioritizing economic stability and employment over strict adherence to the inflation target in the short term.

**Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements:**

- **Dovish Elements:**
  - The Bank expressed concern about economic weakness, stating that "the outlook for growth in the short to medium term has weakened markedly."
  - The communication emphasized the need for additional stimulus, noting that "the MPC judges it appropriate to provide additional stimulus to the economy."
  - The Bank is willing to tolerate a temporary period of above-target inflation to support growth, as indicated by "reducing the amount of spare capacity at the cost of a temporary period of above-target inflation."

- **Neutral Elements:**
  - The Bank acknowledges that the fall in sterling is likely to "push up on CPI inflation in the near term," which is a neutral acknowledgment of inflationary pressures without indicating a shift towards tightening policy.
