### Long Explanation

The communication from the Bank of England (BoE) for December 2017 provides insights into the central bank's assessment of the economic environment and its monetary policy stance. The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.5% and keep the stock of corporate and government bond purchases unchanged. This decision reflects a cautious approach to monetary policy, balancing between supporting economic growth and controlling inflation.

**Inflation and Economic Growth:**
The communication indicates that inflation was at 3.1% in November, above the BoE's target of 2%. This elevated inflation was attributed to the past depreciation of sterling, which increased import prices. However, the MPC expects inflation to decline towards the 2% target over the next three years as the effects of sterling's depreciation diminish. This suggests that while inflation is currently high, the BoE anticipates it will moderate, reducing the urgency for aggressive monetary tightening.

**Economic Activity:**
The BoE's projections show modest GDP growth, slightly above the reduced rate of potential growth. Consumption growth is sluggish but expected to improve with rising household incomes. Business investment is projected to grow modestly despite Brexit uncertainties, supported by strong global demand and favorable financial conditions. The labor market remains tight, with low unemployment expected to persist.

**Monetary Policy Stance:**
The decision to maintain the Bank Rate and asset purchase levels suggests a neutral stance, as the BoE is not taking immediate action to either stimulate or restrain the economy further. The communication does not express significant concern about economic weakness, nor does it emphasize immediate inflation risks that would necessitate a more hawkish (tightening) stance. Instead, it reflects a balanced view, acknowledging both the current inflationary pressures and the expectation of their decline.

**Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements:**
- **Neutral Elements:** The decision to maintain the Bank Rate and asset purchases indicates a neutral stance. The BoE is neither aggressively tightening nor easing monetary policy.
- **Hawkish Elements:** The communication acknowledges that domestic inflationary pressures are projected to pick up gradually, which could be seen as a potential concern for future inflation.
- **Dovish Elements:** The expectation that CPI inflation will decline towards the 2% target suggests a dovish outlook, as it implies less need for immediate rate hikes.
