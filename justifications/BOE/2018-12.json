The Bank of England's communication for December 2018 provides a comprehensive overview of the economic conditions and the monetary policy stance of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The MPC decided to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.75% and keep the stock of corporate and government bond purchases unchanged. This decision reflects a cautious approach in response to a complex economic environment characterized by both domestic and international challenges.

Firstly, the communication highlights concerns about global economic conditions. It notes that "the near-term outlook for global growth has softened and downside risks to growth have increased." This suggests that the Bank is aware of potential global economic weakness, which could impact the UK economy. Additionally, the tightening of global financial conditions, particularly in corporate credit markets, is mentioned, indicating potential challenges for businesses in accessing finance.

Domestically, the communication expresses significant concern about the uncertainties surrounding Brexit. It states that "Brexit uncertainties have intensified considerably," which is affecting UK financial markets. This is evidenced by the rise in UK bank funding costs, increased corporate bond spreads, and the depreciation of sterling. These factors contribute to a more cautious economic outlook, as they can lead to reduced investment and consumer confidence.

The communication also notes that while household consumption indicators have been relatively resilient, there are signs of slowing retail spending, and the housing market remains subdued. This mixed picture of consumer behavior suggests that while some areas of the economy are holding up, others are showing signs of weakness.

On the inflation front, the Bank observes that falling oil prices are likely to lead to a decrease in UK CPI inflation below the 2% target in the coming months. This could be seen as a positive development for consumers, as lower inflation can increase purchasing power. However, it also indicates that inflationary pressures are not a primary concern at this time, which may justify the decision to keep interest rates steady.

Overall, the communication signals a cautious and balanced approach to monetary policy. The Bank is clearly concerned about economic weakness and uncertainties, particularly related to Brexit, but it also acknowledges some positive factors, such as the potential boost from fiscal policy changes and lower oil prices. This results in a mixed stance, as the Bank is neither aggressively tightening nor loosening monetary policy but is instead maintaining its current position while closely monitoring developments.
