The Bank of England's communication for December 2019 provides insights into its monetary policy stance and economic outlook. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.75% with a majority vote of 7-2, indicating a preference to keep monetary policy steady. The decision to maintain the stock of corporate and government bond purchases at their current levels was unanimous, suggesting a consensus on the current policy being appropriate for the economic conditions.

The communication signals a cautiously optimistic outlook for the UK economy. The MPC's projections were based on an assumption of an orderly Brexit transition, which they believed would reduce uncertainties and support economic growth. They expected UK GDP growth to improve from below-potential rates, driven by reduced Brexit-related uncertainties, fiscal policy easing, and a modest global growth recovery. This suggests a belief in a gradual strengthening of the economy, which could lead to "excess demand and domestic inflationary pressures" building over time.

Inflation was projected to rise slightly above the 2% target towards the end of the forecast period, indicating some concern about potential inflationary pressures. However, the current economic data were broadly in line with previous projections, and global growth showed signs of stabilizing. The partial de-escalation of the US-China trade war was seen as a positive development, although trade tensions remained a concern.

The communication also highlighted some economic weaknesses. UK GDP growth was modest, with business investment and export orders remaining weak. The labor market showed signs of loosening, with slowed employment growth and falling vacancies, although the unemployment rate remained stable.

Overall, the communication contains elements of both caution and optimism. The emphasis on potential inflationary pressures and the expectation of economic growth suggest a slightly hawkish tone, as the bank is mindful of inflation risks. However, the acknowledgment of economic weaknesses and the decision to maintain the current policy stance indicate a dovish inclination, as the bank is also concerned about supporting growth and employment.

**Hawkish elements**: The communication mentioned that "excess demand and domestic inflationary pressures were expected to build gradually" and that "CPI inflation was projected to rise to slightly above the 2% target."

**Dovish elements**: The bank expressed concern about "business investment and export orders have remained weak" and noted "some signs that the labour market is loosening."

Given these mixed signals, the overall stance can be considered "mixed," as the bank balances concerns about inflation with the need to support economic growth.
