### Long Explanation

The Bank of England's communication for June 2020 provides insights into its monetary policy decisions and the economic context during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The primary goal of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is to achieve a 2% inflation target while supporting economic growth and employment. Given the severe economic and financial disruptions caused by Covid-19, the Bank's current focus is on stabilizing the economy.

**Monetary Policy Decisions:**
- The MPC decided to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.1%, which is a very low interest rate. This decision is typically aimed at encouraging borrowing and spending by making loans cheaper, which can stimulate economic activity.
- The MPC also continued with its existing bond purchase program, which involves buying £200 billion of UK government and corporate bonds. This action is intended to inject liquidity into the economy, supporting financial markets and lowering borrowing costs.
- Additionally, the MPC decided to increase the target stock of purchased UK government bonds by an additional £100 billion, bringing the total to £745 billion. This further expansion of asset purchases is a measure to provide additional economic support.

**Economic Context and Risks:**
- The communication notes that risky asset prices have recovered somewhat from their March lows, but remain sensitive to pandemic-related news. This indicates ongoing uncertainty in financial markets.
- There are signs of recovery in consumer spending and services output as Covid-related restrictions ease, suggesting some positive momentum in economic activity.
- However, the Bank also highlights downside risks to the global economic outlook, particularly from the potential spread of Covid-19 in emerging markets and the risk of a resurgence in advanced economies.

**UK Economic Indicators:**
- The UK GDP contracted significantly in April, but there are signs of recovery in May and June, as indicated by payments data and housing activity.
- The unemployment rate was stable at 3.9% through April, but other indicators suggest a weakening labor market, with more workers likely to be furloughed and a weak employment outlook.

**Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements:**
- **Dovish Elements:** The decision to maintain a low Bank Rate and expand asset purchases reflects a dovish stance, indicating a focus on supporting economic recovery and addressing economic weakness. The communication expresses concern about economic weakness, as evidenced by phrases like "severe economic and financial disruption" and "GDP contracted by around 20% in April."
- **Neutral Elements:** The unanimous decision to maintain the Bank Rate and continue with existing bond purchases suggests a consensus on the current policy stance. The mention of "signs of consumer spending and services output picking up" indicates some optimism about recovery, balancing the overall dovish tone.
