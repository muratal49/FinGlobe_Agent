**Long Explanation:**

The communication from the Bank of England for June 2021 primarily signaled a continuation of its existing monetary policy stance. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.1% and continue with its asset purchase program, which includes maintaining the stock of corporate bond purchases at £20 billion and government bond purchases at £875 billion. This decision reflects a cautious approach to monetary policy, suggesting that the Bank is not in a hurry to tighten monetary conditions despite some signs of economic recovery.

The communication highlighted several key economic indicators and projections. The Bank noted that UK GDP was expected to recover strongly over 2021 to pre-Covid-19 levels, with spare capacity in the economy expected to be eliminated as activity picked up. However, it also projected a temporary period of excess demand before demand and supply returned to balance. This indicates that while the economy is recovering, there are still uncertainties and potential imbalances that need to be monitored.

Inflation was projected to rise temporarily above the 2% target, mainly due to developments in energy prices. However, the Bank expected these effects to be transitory, with inflation returning to around 2% in the medium term. This suggests that the Bank is not overly concerned about long-term inflationary pressures at this point.

In terms of global economic conditions, the Bank noted that global GDP growth had been stronger than anticipated, particularly in advanced economies. It also observed that global price pressures had increased due to strong demand for goods, rising commodity prices, supply-side constraints, and transportation bottlenecks. These factors have started to affect consumer price inflation in some advanced economies, but financial market measures suggest that this inflation strength is expected to be temporary.

Overall, the communication can be characterized as neutral with some dovish elements. The Bank acknowledged the economic recovery and temporary inflationary pressures but maintained its accommodative monetary policy stance, indicating a focus on supporting growth and employment rather than preemptively tightening policy to combat inflation.

**Hawkish/Dovish/Neutral Elements:**

- **Neutral Elements:**
  - The decision to maintain the Bank Rate at 0.1% and continue with the existing asset purchase program indicates a neutral stance, as the Bank is neither tightening nor loosening monetary policy.
  - The expectation that inflation will return to around 2% in the medium term suggests that the Bank is not overly concerned about long-term inflationary pressures.

- **Dovish Elements:**
  - The emphasis on supporting economic recovery and employment, as indicated by the statement that "UK GDP was expected to recover strongly over 2021, to pre-Covid-19 levels."
  - The acknowledgment of temporary inflationary pressures due to energy prices, with the expectation that these effects will fade, reflects a dovish view that current inflation is not a major concern.

**Direct Evidence from the Text:**

- "The Committee judged that the existing stance of monetary policy remained appropriate."
- "CPI inflation was projected to rise temporarily above the 2% target, owing mainly to developments in energy prices."
- "UK GDP was expected to recover strongly over 2021, to pre-Covid-19 levels."
- "Financial market measures of inflation expectations suggest that the near-term strength in inflation is expected to be transitory."
