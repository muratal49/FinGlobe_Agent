# The supply side demands more attention âˆ’ speech by Megan Greene
**Speaker:** Megan Greene

**Date:** 2025-09-24

In her speech, Megan Greene presents a nuanced perspective on how central banks should address supply shocks, suggesting a shift from the traditional approach of looking through these shocks. She argues that supply shocks, driven by factors such as climate change and geopolitical tensions, are becoming more frequent and severe, necessitating a reevaluation of monetary policy responses.

Greene highlights the distinction between supply and demand shocks, noting that supply shocks often result in inflation and output moving in opposite directions, unlike demand shocks where they move in the same direction. This creates a complex trade-off for central banks, which traditionally focus on demand management tools to stabilize prices and output.

She emphasizes the importance of understanding the supply side of the economy, as it impacts inflation and economic activity. Greene suggests that central banks may need to adapt their strategies, particularly in response to negative supply shocks, which pose a challenge by simultaneously pushing inflation up and output down.

While Greene acknowledges that central banks have historically responded more strongly to demand-driven inflation, she argues that the increasing prevalence of supply shocks requires a more balanced approach. She calls for central banks to consider the structural and persistent nature of some supply shocks and the potential need for policy adjustments to address them effectively.

Overall, Greene's speech signals a more hawkish stance on the need to address supply-driven inflation, while recognizing the limitations of traditional monetary policy tools in directly influencing supply-side factors.
