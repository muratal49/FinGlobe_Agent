# Bumps in the road? âˆ’ speech by Sarah Breeden
**Speaker:** Sarah Breeden

**Date:** 2025-09-30

In her speech at Cardiff Business School, Sarah Breeden addressed the recent trajectory of inflation in the UK, highlighting both external and domestic factors contributing to current economic conditions. She noted that while inflation had decreased from its peak in 2022, it has recently risen again to 3.8% in August and is expected to reach around 4% in September. This increase is primarily attributed to external factors such as administered prices and global commodity price shocks, rather than domestic inflationary pressures.

Breeden acknowledged the potential for these external shocks to lead to second-round effects, where wages and other prices could rise in response, prolonging inflation. However, she expressed confidence that the current economic environment, characterized by a looser labor market and weaker demand, reduces the likelihood of such persistence.

The speech conveyed a cautious outlook on inflation expectations, noting that household expectations have risen, particularly in response to food prices. However, firms' inflation expectations have remained more stable, suggesting limited immediate pressure on wages.

Breeden also discussed the ongoing disinflation from the 2022 shock, noting a stalling in the downward trajectory of services price inflation. This could indicate a potential plateau rather than a continued decline, warranting close monitoring.

Overall, the speech contained a mix of hawkish and dovish elements. The acknowledgment of rising inflation and the focus on preventing second-round effects suggest a hawkish stance. However, the recognition of external factors and the looser economic conditions that might mitigate inflationary pressures introduce dovish considerations. The speech did not provide explicit forward guidance on monetary policy adjustments but emphasized the importance of closely monitoring inflation dynamics.
